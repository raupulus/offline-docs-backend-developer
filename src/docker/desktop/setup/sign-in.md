Docker recommends signing in with the **Sign in** option in the top-right corner of the Docker Dashboard. 

In large enterprises where admin access is restricted, administrators can [enforce sign-in](../../enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/index.md). 

> [!TIP]
>
> Explore [Docker's core subscriptions](https://www.docker.com/pricing?ref=Docs&refAction=DocsDesktopSignIn) to see what else Docker can offer you. 

## Benefits of signing in

- Access your Docker Hub repositories directly from Docker Desktop.

- Increase your pull rate limit compared to anonymous users. See [Usage and limits](../../docker-hub/usage/index.md).

- Enhance your organization’s security posture for containerized development with [Hardened Desktop](../../enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/index.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker Desktop automatically signs you out after 90 days, or after 30 days of inactivity. 

## Signing in with Docker Desktop for Linux

Docker Desktop for Linux relies on [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) to store credentials in GPG-encrypted files.
Before signing in to Docker Desktop with your [Docker ID](/accounts/individual/create-account/), you must initialize `pass`.
Docker Desktop displays a warning if `pass` is not configured.

1. Generate a GPG key. You can initialize pass by using a gpg key. To generate a gpg key, run:

   ``` console
   $ gpg --generate-key
   ``` 
2. Enter your name and email once prompted. 

   Once confirmed, GPG creates a key pair. Look for the `pub` line that contains your GPG ID, for example:

   ```text
   ...
   pubrsa3072 2022-03-31 [SC] [expires: 2024-03-30]
    3ABCD1234EF56G78
   uid          Molly <molly@example.com>
   ```
3. Copy the GPG ID and use it to initialize `pass`. For example

   ```console
   $ pass init 3ABCD1234EF56G78
   ``` 

   You should see output similar to: 

   ```text
   mkdir: created directory '/home/molly/.password-store/'
   Password store initialized for <generated_gpg-id_public_key>
   ```

Once you initialize `pass`, you can sign in and pull your private images.
When Docker CLI or Docker Desktop use credentials, a user prompt may pop up for the password you set during the GPG key generation.

```console
$ docker pull molly/privateimage
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from molly/privateimage
