## libpq C Library

libpq

C

libpq is the C application programmer's interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a set of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of these queries.

libpq is also the underlying engine for several other PostgreSQL application interfaces, including those written for C++, Perl, Python, Tcl and ECPG. So some aspects of libpq's behavior will be important to you if you use one of those packages. In particular, [Environment Variables](#libpq-envars), [The Password File](#libpq-pgpass) and [SSL Support](#libpq-ssl) describe behavior that is visible to the user of any application that uses libpq.

Some short programs are included at the end of this chapter ([Example Programs](#libpq-example)) to show how to write programs that use libpq. There are also several complete examples of libpq applications in the directory `src/test/examples` in the source code distribution.

Client programs that use libpq must include the header file `libpq-fe.h`<span class="indexterm"></span> and must link with the libpq library.

## Database Connection Control Functions

The following functions deal with making a connection to a PostgreSQL backend server. An application program can have several backend connections open at one time. (One reason to do that is to access more than one database.) Each connection is represented by a PGconn<span class="indexterm"></span> object, which is obtained from the function [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdbParams), or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetdbLogin). Note that these functions will always return a non-null object pointer, unless perhaps there is too little memory even to allocate the PGconn object. The [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus) function should be called to check the return value for a successful connection before queries are sent via the connection object.

> [!WARNING]
> If untrusted users have access to a database that has not adopted a [secure schema usage pattern](#ddl-schemas-patterns), begin each session by removing publicly-writable schemas from `search_path`. One can set parameter key word `options` to value `-csearch_path=`. Alternately, one can issue `PQexec(conn, "SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false)")` after connecting. This consideration is not specific to libpq; it applies to every interface for executing arbitrary SQL commands.

> [!WARNING]
> On Unix, forking a process with open libpq connections can lead to unpredictable results because the parent and child processes share the same sockets and operating system resources. For this reason, such usage is not recommended, though doing an `exec` from the child process to load a new executable is safe.

`PQconnectdbParams`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Makes a new connection to the database server. PGconn \*PQconnectdbParams(const char \* const \*keywords, const char \* const \*values, int expand_dbname);

This function opens a new database connection using the parameters taken from two `NULL`-terminated arrays. The first, `keywords`, is defined as an array of strings, each one being a key word. The second, `values`, gives the value for each key word. Unlike [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetdbLogin) below, the parameter set can be extended without changing the function signature, so use of this function (or its nonblocking analogs [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams) and `PQconnectPoll`) is preferred for new application programming.

The currently recognized parameter key words are listed in [Parameter Key Words](#libpq-paramkeywords).

The passed arrays can be empty to use all default parameters, or can contain one or more parameter settings. They must be matched in length. Processing will stop at the first `NULL` entry in the `keywords` array. Also, if the `values` entry associated with a non-`NULL` `keywords` entry is `NULL` or an empty string, that entry is ignored and processing continues with the next pair of array entries.

When `expand_dbname` is non-zero, the value for the first `dbname` key word is checked to see if it is a connection string. If so, it is “expanded” into the individual connection parameters extracted from the string. The value is considered to be a connection string, rather than just a database name, if it contains an equal sign (`=`) or it begins with a URI scheme designator. (More details on connection string formats appear in [Connection Strings](#libpq-connstring).) Only the first occurrence of `dbname` is treated in this way; any subsequent `dbname` parameter is processed as a plain database name.

In general the parameter arrays are processed from start to end. If any key word is repeated, the last value (that is not `NULL` or empty) is used. This rule applies in particular when a key word found in a connection string conflicts with one appearing in the `keywords` array. Thus, the programmer may determine whether array entries can override or be overridden by values taken from a connection string. Array entries appearing before an expanded `dbname` entry can be overridden by fields of the connection string, and in turn those fields are overridden by array entries appearing after `dbname` (but, again, only if those entries supply non-empty values).

After processing all the array entries and any expanded connection string, any connection parameters that remain unset are filled with default values. If an unset parameter's corresponding environment variable (see [Environment Variables](#libpq-envars)) is set, its value is used. If the environment variable is not set either, then the parameter's built-in default value is used.

`PQconnectdb`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Makes a new connection to the database server. PGconn \*PQconnectdb(const char \*conninfo);

This function opens a new database connection using the parameters taken from the string `conninfo`.

The passed string can be empty to use all default parameters, or it can contain one or more parameter settings separated by whitespace, or it can contain a URI. See [Connection Strings](#libpq-connstring) for details.

`PQsetdbLogin`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Makes a new connection to the database server. PGconn \*PQsetdbLogin(const char \*pghost, const char \*pgport, const char \*pgoptions, const char \*pgtty, const char \*dbName, const char \*login, const char \*pwd);

This is the predecessor of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb) with a fixed set of parameters. It has the same functionality except that the missing parameters will always take on default values. Write `NULL` or an empty string for any one of the fixed parameters that is to be defaulted.

If the `dbName` contains an `=` sign or has a valid connection URI prefix, it is taken as a `conninfo` string in exactly the same way as if it had been passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb), and the remaining parameters are then applied as specified for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdbParams).

`pgtty` is no longer used and any value passed will be ignored.

`PQsetdb`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Makes a new connection to the database server. PGconn \*PQsetdb(char \*pghost, char \*pgport, char \*pgoptions, char \*pgtty, char \*dbName);

This is a macro that calls [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetdbLogin) with null pointers for the `login` and `pwd` parameters. It is provided for backward compatibility with very old programs.

`PQconnectStartParams`<span class="indexterm"></span>; `PQconnectStart`<span class="indexterm"></span>; `PQconnectPoll`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
<span class="indexterm"></span> Make a connection to the database server in a nonblocking manner. PGconn \*PQconnectStartParams(const char \* const \*keywords, const char \* const \*values, int expand_dbname); PGconn \*PQconnectStart(const char \*conninfo); PostgresPollingStatusType PQconnectPoll(PGconn \*conn);

These three functions are used to open a connection to a database server such that your application's thread of execution is not blocked on remote I/O whilst doing so. The point of this approach is that the waits for I/O to complete can occur in the application's main loop, rather than down inside [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdbParams) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb), and so the application can manage this operation in parallel with other activities.

With [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams), the database connection is made using the parameters taken from the `keywords` and `values` arrays, and controlled by `expand_dbname`, as described above for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdbParams).

With `PQconnectStart`, the database connection is made using the parameters taken from the string `conninfo` as described above for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb).

Neither [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams) nor `PQconnectStart` nor `PQconnectPoll` will block, so long as a number of restrictions are met:

- The `hostaddr` parameter must be used appropriately to prevent DNS queries from being made. See the documentation of this parameter in [Parameter Key Words](#libpq-paramkeywords) for details.

- If you call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQtrace), ensure that the stream object into which you trace will not block.

- You must ensure that the socket is in the appropriate state before calling `PQconnectPoll`, as described below.

To begin a nonblocking connection request, call `PQconnectStart` or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams). If the result is null, then libpq has been unable to allocate a new PGconn structure. Otherwise, a valid PGconn pointer is returned (though not yet representing a valid connection to the database). Next call `PQstatus(conn)`. If the result is `CONNECTION_BAD`, the connection attempt has already failed, typically because of invalid connection parameters.

If `PQconnectStart` or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams) succeeds, the next stage is to poll libpq so that it can proceed with the connection sequence. Use `PQsocket(conn)` to obtain the descriptor of the socket underlying the database connection. (Caution: do not assume that the socket remains the same across `PQconnectPoll` calls.) Loop thus: If `PQconnectPoll(conn)` last returned `PGRES_POLLING_READING`, wait until the socket is ready to read (as indicated by `select()`, `poll()`, or similar system function). Note that `PQsocketPoll` can help reduce boilerplate by abstracting the setup of `select(2)` or `poll(2)` if it is available on your system. Then call `PQconnectPoll(conn)` again. Conversely, if `PQconnectPoll(conn)` last returned `PGRES_POLLING_WRITING`, wait until the socket is ready to write, then call `PQconnectPoll(conn)` again. On the first iteration, i.e., if you have yet to call `PQconnectPoll`, behave as if it last returned `PGRES_POLLING_WRITING`. Continue this loop until `PQconnectPoll(conn)` returns `PGRES_POLLING_FAILED`, indicating the connection procedure has failed, or `PGRES_POLLING_OK`, indicating the connection has been successfully made.

At any time during connection, the status of the connection can be checked by calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus). If this call returns `CONNECTION_BAD`, then the connection procedure has failed; if the call returns `CONNECTION_OK`, then the connection is ready. Both of these states are equally detectable from the return value of `PQconnectPoll`, described above. Other states might also occur during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These indicate the current stage of the connection procedure and might be useful to provide feedback to the user for example. These statuses are:

`CONNECTION_STARTED`  
Waiting for connection to be made.

`CONNECTION_MADE`  
Connection OK; waiting to send.

`CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE`  
Waiting for a response from the server.

`CONNECTION_AUTH_OK`  
Received authentication; waiting for backend start-up to finish.

`CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP`  
Negotiating SSL encryption.

`CONNECTION_GSS_STARTUP`  
Negotiating GSS encryption.

`CONNECTION_CHECK_WRITABLE`  
Checking if connection is able to handle write transactions.

`CONNECTION_CHECK_STANDBY`  
Checking if connection is to a server in standby mode.

`CONNECTION_CONSUME`  
Consuming any remaining response messages on connection.

Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain compatibility), an application should never rely upon these occurring in a particular order, or at all, or on the status always being one of these documented values. An application might do something like this:

    switch(PQstatus(conn))
    {
            case CONNECTION_STARTED:
                feedback = "Connecting...";
                break;

            case CONNECTION_MADE:
                feedback = "Connected to server...";
                break;
    .
    .
    .
            default:
                feedback = "Connecting...";
    }

The `connect_timeout` connection parameter is ignored when using `PQconnectPoll`; it is the application's responsibility to decide whether an excessive amount of time has elapsed. Otherwise, `PQconnectStart` followed by a `PQconnectPoll` loop is equivalent to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb).

Note that when `PQconnectStart` or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams) returns a non-null pointer, you must call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish) when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of the structure and any associated memory blocks. This must be done even if the connection attempt fails or is abandoned.

`PQsocketPoll`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
<span class="indexterm"></span> Poll a connection's underlying socket descriptor retrieved with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsocket). The primary use of this function is iterating through the connection sequence described in the documentation of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams). typedef pg_int64 pg_usec_time_t; int PQsocketPoll(int sock, int forRead, int forWrite, pg_usec_time_t end_time);

This function performs polling of a file descriptor, optionally with a timeout. If `forRead` is nonzero, the function will terminate when the socket is ready for reading. If `forWrite` is nonzero, the function will terminate when the socket is ready for writing.

The timeout is specified by `end_time`, which is the time to stop waiting expressed as a number of microseconds since the Unix epoch (that is, `time_t` times 1 million). Timeout is infinite if `end_time` is `-1`. Timeout is immediate (no blocking) if end_time is `0` (or indeed, any time before now). Timeout values can be calculated conveniently by adding the desired number of microseconds to the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCurrentTimeUSec). Note that the underlying system calls may have less than microsecond precision, so that the actual delay may be imprecise.

The function returns a value greater than `0` if the specified condition is met, `0` if a timeout occurred, or `-1` if an error occurred. The error can be retrieved by checking the `errno(3)` value. In the event both `forRead` and `forWrite` are zero, the function immediately returns a timeout indication.

`PQsocketPoll` is implemented using either `poll(2)` or `select(2)`, depending on platform. See `POLLIN` and `POLLOUT` from `poll(2)`, or `readfds` and `writefds` from `select(2)`, for more information.

`PQconndefaults`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the default connection options. PQconninfoOption \*PQconndefaults(void); typedef struct { char \*keyword; /\* The keyword of the option \*/ char \*envvar; /\* Fallback environment variable name \*/ char \*compiled; /\* Fallback compiled in default value \*/ char \*val; /\* Option's current value, or NULL \*/ char \*label; /\* Label for field in connect dialog \*/ char \*dispchar; /\* Indicates how to display this field in a connect dialog. Values are: "" Display entered value as is "\*" Password field - hide value "D" Debug option - don't show by default \*/ int dispsize; /\* Field size in characters for dialog \*/ } PQconninfoOption;

Returns a connection options array. This can be used to determine all possible [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb) options and their current default values. The return value points to an array of PQconninfoOption structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer. The null pointer is returned if memory could not be allocated. Note that the current default values (val fields) will depend on environment variables and other context. A missing or invalid service file will be silently ignored. Callers must treat the connection options data as read-only.

After processing the options array, free it by passing it to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconninfoFree). If this is not done, a small amount of memory is leaked for each call to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconndefaults).

`PQconninfo`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the connection options used by a live connection. PQconninfoOption \*PQconninfo(PGconn \*conn);

Returns a connection options array. This can be used to determine all possible [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb) options and the values that were used to connect to the server. The return value points to an array of PQconninfoOption structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer. All notes above for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconndefaults) also apply to the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconninfo).

`PQconninfoParse`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns parsed connection options from the provided connection string. PQconninfoOption \*PQconninfoParse(const char \*conninfo, char \*\*errmsg);

Parses a connection string and returns the resulting options as an array; or returns `NULL` if there is a problem with the connection string. This function can be used to extract the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb) options in the provided connection string. The return value points to an array of PQconninfoOption structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer.

All legal options will be present in the result array, but the `PQconninfoOption` for any option not present in the connection string will have `val` set to `NULL`; default values are not inserted.

If `errmsg` is not `NULL`, then `*errmsg` is set to `NULL` on success, else to a `malloc`'d error string explaining the problem. (It is also possible for `*errmsg` to be set to `NULL` and the function to return `NULL`; this indicates an out-of-memory condition.)

After processing the options array, free it by passing it to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconninfoFree). If this is not done, some memory is leaked for each call to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconninfoParse). Conversely, if an error occurs and `errmsg` is not `NULL`, be sure to free the error string using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem).

`PQfinish`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Closes the connection to the server. Also frees memory used by the PGconn object. void PQfinish(PGconn \*conn);

Note that even if the server connection attempt fails (as indicated by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus)), the application should call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish) to free the memory used by the PGconn object. The PGconn pointer must not be used again after [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish) has been called.

`PQreset`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Resets the communication channel to the server. void PQreset(PGconn \*conn);

This function will close the connection to the server and attempt to establish a new connection, using all the same parameters previously used. This might be useful for error recovery if a working connection is lost.

`PQresetStart`<span class="indexterm"></span>; `PQresetPoll`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Reset the communication channel to the server, in a nonblocking manner. int PQresetStart(PGconn \*conn); PostgresPollingStatusType PQresetPoll(PGconn \*conn);

These functions will close the connection to the server and attempt to establish a new connection, using all the same parameters previously used. This can be useful for error recovery if a working connection is lost. They differ from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQreset) (above) in that they act in a nonblocking manner. These functions suffer from the same restrictions as [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams), `PQconnectStart` and `PQconnectPoll`.

To initiate a connection reset, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresetStart). If it returns 0, the reset has failed. If it returns 1, poll the reset using `PQresetPoll` in exactly the same way as you would create the connection using `PQconnectPoll`.

`PQpingParams`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpingParams) reports the status of the server. It accepts connection parameters identical to those of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdbParams), described above. It is not necessary to supply correct user name, password, or database name values to obtain the server status; however, if incorrect values are provided, the server will log a failed connection attempt. PGPing PQpingParams(const char \* const \*keywords, const char \* const \*values, int expand_dbname); The function returns one of the following values:

`PQPING_OK`  
The server is running and appears to be accepting connections.

`PQPING_REJECT`  
The server is running but is in a state that disallows connections (startup, shutdown, or crash recovery).

`PQPING_NO_RESPONSE`  
The server could not be contacted. This might indicate that the server is not running, or that there is something wrong with the given connection parameters (for example, wrong port number), or that there is a network connectivity problem (for example, a firewall blocking the connection request).

`PQPING_NO_ATTEMPT`  
No attempt was made to contact the server, because the supplied parameters were obviously incorrect or there was some client-side problem (for example, out of memory).

`PQping`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQping) reports the status of the server. It accepts connection parameters identical to those of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb), described above. It is not necessary to supply correct user name, password, or database name values to obtain the server status; however, if incorrect values are provided, the server will log a failed connection attempt. PGPing PQping(const char \*conninfo);

The return values are the same as for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpingParams).

`PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
`PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL` lets an application override libpq's [default handling of encrypted client certificate key files](#libpq-ssl-clientcert) using [sslpassword](#libpq-connect-sslpassword) or interactive prompting. void PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL(PQsslKeyPassHook_OpenSSL_type hook); The application passes a pointer to a callback function with signature:

    int callback_fn(char *buf, int size, PGconn *conn);

which libpq will then call *instead of* its default `PQdefaultSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL` handler. The callback should determine the password for the key and copy it to result-buffer `buf` of size `size`. The string in `buf` must be null-terminated. The callback must return the length of the password stored in `buf` excluding the null terminator. On failure, the callback should set `buf[0] = '\0'` and return 0. See `PQdefaultSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL` in libpq's source code for an example.

If the user specified an explicit key location, its path will be in `conn->sslkey` when the callback is invoked. This will be empty if the default key path is being used. For keys that are engine specifiers, it is up to engine implementations whether they use the OpenSSL password callback or define their own handling.

The app callback may choose to delegate unhandled cases to `PQdefaultSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL`, or call it first and try something else if it returns 0, or completely override it.

The callback *must not* escape normal flow control with exceptions, `longjmp(...)`, etc. It must return normally.

`PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
`PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL` returns the current client certificate key password hook, or `NULL` if none has been set. PQsslKeyPassHook_OpenSSL_type PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL(void);

### Connection Strings

conninfo

URI

Several libpq functions parse a user-specified string to obtain connection parameters. There are two accepted formats for these strings: plain keyword/value strings and URIs. URIs generally follow [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), except that multi-host connection strings are allowed as further described below.

#### Keyword/Value Connection Strings

In the keyword/value format, each parameter setting is in the form \<keyword\> `=` \<value\>, with space(s) between settings. Spaces around a setting's equal sign are optional. To write an empty value, or a value containing spaces, surround it with single quotes, for example `keyword = 'a value'`. Single quotes and backslashes within a value must be escaped with a backslash, i.e., `\'` and `\\`.

Example:

    host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb connect_timeout=10

The recognized parameter key words are listed in [Parameter Key Words](#libpq-paramkeywords).

#### Connection URIs

The general form for a connection URI is: postgresql://\[\<userspec\>@\]\[\<hostspec\>\]\[/\<dbname\>\]\[?\<paramspec\>\] where \<userspec\> is: \<user\>\[:\<password\>\] and \<hostspec\> is: \[\<host\>\]\[:\<port\>\]\[,...\] and \<paramspec\> is: \<name\>=\<value\>\[&...\]

The URI scheme designator can be either `postgresql://` or `postgres://`. Each of the remaining URI parts is optional. The following examples illustrate valid URI syntax:

    postgresql://
    postgresql://localhost
    postgresql://localhost:5433
    postgresql://localhost/mydb
    postgresql://user@localhost
    postgresql://user:secret@localhost
    postgresql://other@localhost/otherdb?connect_timeout=10&application_name=myapp
    postgresql://host1:123,host2:456/somedb?target_session_attrs=any&application_name=myapp

Values that would normally appear in the hierarchical part of the URI can alternatively be given as named parameters. For example:

    postgresql:///mydb?host=localhost&port=5433

All named parameters must match key words listed in [Parameter Key Words](#libpq-paramkeywords), except that for compatibility with JDBC connection URIs, instances of `ssl=true` are translated into `sslmode=require`.

The connection URI needs to be encoded with [percent-encoding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1) if it includes symbols with special meaning in any of its parts. Here is an example where the equal sign (`=`) is replaced with `%3D` and the space character with `%20`:

    postgresql://user@localhost:5433/mydb?options=-c%20synchronous_commit%3Doff

The host part may be either a host name or an IP address. To specify an IPv6 address, enclose it in square brackets: postgresql://\[2001:db8::1234\]/database

The host part is interpreted as described for the parameter [host](#libpq-connect-host). In particular, a Unix-domain socket connection is chosen if the host part is either empty or looks like an absolute path name, otherwise a TCP/IP connection is initiated. Note, however, that the slash is a reserved character in the hierarchical part of the URI. So, to specify a non-standard Unix-domain socket directory, either omit the host part of the URI and specify the host as a named parameter, or percent-encode the path in the host part of the URI:

    postgresql:///dbname?host=/var/lib/postgresql
    postgresql://%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql/dbname

It is possible to specify multiple host components, each with an optional port component, in a single URI. A URI of the form `postgresql://host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/` is equivalent to a connection string of the form `host=host1,host2,host3 port=port1,port2,port3`. As further described below, each host will be tried in turn until a connection is successfully established.

#### Specifying Multiple Hosts

It is possible to specify multiple hosts to connect to, so that they are tried in the given order. In the Keyword/Value format, the `host`, `hostaddr`, and `port` options accept comma-separated lists of values. The same number of elements must be given in each option that is specified, such that e.g., the first `hostaddr` corresponds to the first host name, the second `hostaddr` corresponds to the second host name, and so forth. As an exception, if only one `port` is specified, it applies to all the hosts.

In the connection URI format, you can list multiple `host:port` pairs separated by commas in the `host` component of the URI.

In either format, a single host name can translate to multiple network addresses. A common example of this is a host that has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.

When multiple hosts are specified, or when a single host name is translated to multiple addresses, all the hosts and addresses will be tried in order, until one succeeds. If none of the hosts can be reached, the connection fails. If a connection is established successfully, but authentication fails, the remaining hosts in the list are not tried.

If a password file is used, you can have different passwords for different hosts. All the other connection options are the same for every host in the list; it is not possible to e.g., specify different usernames for different hosts.

### Parameter Key Words

The currently recognized parameter key words are:

`host`  
Name of host to connect to.<span class="indexterm"></span> If a host name looks like an absolute path name, it specifies Unix-domain communication rather than TCP/IP communication; the value is the name of the directory in which the socket file is stored. (On Unix, an absolute path name begins with a slash. On Windows, paths starting with drive letters are also recognized.) If the host name starts with `@`, it is taken as a Unix-domain socket in the abstract namespace (currently supported on Linux and Windows). The default behavior when `host` is not specified, or is empty, is to connect to a Unix-domain socket<span class="indexterm"></span> in `/tmp` (or whatever socket directory was specified when PostgreSQL was built). On Windows, the default is to connect to `localhost`.

A comma-separated list of host names is also accepted, in which case each host name in the list is tried in order; an empty item in the list selects the default behavior as explained above. See [Specifying Multiple Hosts](#libpq-multiple-hosts) for details.

`hostaddr`  
Numeric IP address of host to connect to. This should be in the standard IPv4 address format, e.g., `172.28.40.9`. If your machine supports IPv6, you can also use those addresses. TCP/IP communication is always used when a nonempty string is specified for this parameter. If this parameter is not specified, the value of `host` will be looked up to find the corresponding IP address or, if `host` specifies an IP address, that value will be used directly.

Using `hostaddr` allows the application to avoid a host name look-up, which might be important in applications with time constraints. However, a host name is required for GSSAPI or SSPI authentication methods, as well as for `verify-full` SSL certificate verification. The following rules are used:

- If `host` is specified without `hostaddr`, a host name lookup occurs. (When using `PQconnectPoll`, the lookup occurs when `PQconnectPoll` first considers this host name, and it may cause `PQconnectPoll` to block for a significant amount of time.)

- If `hostaddr` is specified without `host`, the value for `hostaddr` gives the server network address. The connection attempt will fail if the authentication method requires a host name.

- If both `host` and `hostaddr` are specified, the value for `hostaddr` gives the server network address. The value for `host` is ignored unless the authentication method requires it, in which case it will be used as the host name.

Note that authentication is likely to fail if `host` is not the name of the server at network address `hostaddr`. Also, when both `host` and `hostaddr` are specified, `host` is used to identify the connection in a password file (see [The Password File](#libpq-pgpass)).

A comma-separated list of `hostaddr` values is also accepted, in which case each host in the list is tried in order. An empty item in the list causes the corresponding host name to be used, or the default host name if that is empty as well. See [Specifying Multiple Hosts](#libpq-multiple-hosts) for details.

Without either a host name or host address, libpq will connect using a local Unix-domain socket; or on Windows, it will attempt to connect to `localhost`.

`port`  
Port number to connect to at the server host, or socket file name extension for Unix-domain connections.<span class="indexterm"></span> If multiple hosts were given in the `host` or `hostaddr` parameters, this parameter may specify a comma-separated list of ports of the same length as the host list, or it may specify a single port number to be used for all hosts. An empty string, or an empty item in a comma-separated list, specifies the default port number established when PostgreSQL was built.

`dbname`  
The database name. Defaults to be the same as the user name. In certain contexts, the value is checked for extended formats; see [Connection Strings](#libpq-connstring) for more details on those.

`user`  
PostgreSQL user name to connect as. Defaults to be the same as the operating system name of the user running the application.

`password`  
Password to be used if the server demands password authentication.

`passfile`  
Specifies the name of the file used to store passwords (see [The Password File](#libpq-pgpass)). Defaults to `~/.pgpass`, or `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf` on Microsoft Windows. (No error is reported if this file does not exist.)

`require_auth`  
Specifies the authentication method that the client requires from the server. If the server does not use the required method to authenticate the client, or if the authentication handshake is not fully completed by the server, the connection will fail. A comma-separated list of methods may also be provided, of which the server must use exactly one in order for the connection to succeed. By default, any authentication method is accepted, and the server is free to skip authentication altogether.

Methods may be negated with the addition of a `!` prefix, in which case the server must *not* attempt the listed method; any other method is accepted, and the server is free not to authenticate the client at all. If a comma-separated list is provided, the server may not attempt *any* of the listed negated methods. Negated and non-negated forms may not be combined in the same setting.

As a final special case, the `none` method requires the server not to use an authentication challenge. (It may also be negated, to require some form of authentication.)

The following methods may be specified:

`password`  
The server must request plaintext password authentication.

`md5`  
The server must request MD5 hashed password authentication.

`gss`  
The server must either request a Kerberos handshake via GSSAPI or establish a GSS-encrypted channel (see also [gssencmode](#libpq-connect-gssencmode)).

`sspi`  
The server must request Windows SSPI authentication.

`scram-sha-256`  
The server must successfully complete a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange with the client.

`none`  
The server must not prompt the client for an authentication exchange. (This does not prohibit client certificate authentication via TLS, nor GSS authentication via its encrypted transport.)

`channel_binding`  
This option controls the client's use of channel binding. A setting of `require` means that the connection must employ channel binding, `prefer` means that the client will choose channel binding if available, and `disable` prevents the use of channel binding. The default is `prefer` if PostgreSQL is compiled with SSL support; otherwise the default is `disable`.

Channel binding is a method for the server to authenticate itself to the client. It is only supported over SSL connections with PostgreSQL 11 or later servers using the `SCRAM` authentication method.

`connect_timeout`  
Maximum time to wait while connecting, in seconds (write as a decimal integer, e.g., `10`). Zero, negative, or not specified means wait indefinitely. This timeout applies separately to each host name or IP address. For example, if you specify two hosts and `connect_timeout` is 5, each host will time out if no connection is made within 5 seconds, so the total time spent waiting for a connection might be up to 10 seconds.

`client_encoding`  
This sets the `client_encoding` configuration parameter for this connection. In addition to the values accepted by the corresponding server option, you can use `auto` to determine the right encoding from the current locale in the client (`LC_CTYPE` environment variable on Unix systems).

`options`  
Specifies command-line options to send to the server at connection start. For example, setting this to `-c geqo=off` or `--geqo=off` sets the session's value of the `geqo` parameter to `off`. Spaces within this string are considered to separate command-line arguments, unless escaped with a backslash (`\`); write `\\` to represent a literal backslash. For a detailed discussion of the available options, consult [???](#runtime-config).

`application_name`  
Specifies a value for the [???](#guc-application-name) configuration parameter.

`fallback_application_name`  
Specifies a fallback value for the [???](#guc-application-name) configuration parameter. This value will be used if no value has been given for `application_name` via a connection parameter or the `PGAPPNAME` environment variable. Specifying a fallback name is useful in generic utility programs that wish to set a default application name but allow it to be overridden by the user.

`keepalives`  
Controls whether client-side TCP keepalives are used. The default value is 1, meaning on, but you can change this to 0, meaning off, if keepalives are not wanted. This parameter is ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket.

`keepalives_idle`  
Controls the number of seconds of inactivity after which TCP should send a keepalive message to the server. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only supported on systems where `TCP_KEEPIDLE` or an equivalent socket option is available, and on Windows; on other systems, it has no effect.

`keepalives_interval`  
Controls the number of seconds after which a TCP keepalive message that is not acknowledged by the server should be retransmitted. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only supported on systems where `TCP_KEEPINTVL` or an equivalent socket option is available, and on Windows; on other systems, it has no effect.

`keepalives_count`  
Controls the number of TCP keepalives that can be lost before the client's connection to the server is considered dead. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only supported on systems where `TCP_KEEPCNT` or an equivalent socket option is available; on other systems, it has no effect.

`tcp_user_timeout`  
Controls the number of milliseconds that transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcibly closed. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket. It is only supported on systems where `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` is available; on other systems, it has no effect.

`replication`  
This option determines whether the connection should use the replication protocol instead of the normal protocol. This is what PostgreSQL replication connections as well as tools such as pg_basebackup use internally, but it can also be used by third-party applications. For a description of the replication protocol, consult [???](#protocol-replication).

The following values, which are case-insensitive, are supported:

`true`, `on`, `yes`, `1`  
The connection goes into physical replication mode.

`database`  
The connection goes into logical replication mode, connecting to the database specified in the `dbname` parameter.

`false`, `off`, `no`, `0`  
The connection is a regular one, which is the default behavior.

In physical or logical replication mode, only the simple query protocol can be used.

`gssencmode`  
This option determines whether or with what priority a secure GSS TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. There are three modes:

`disable`  
only try a non-GSSAPI-encrypted connection

`prefer` (default)  
if there are GSSAPI credentials present (i.e., in a credentials cache), first try a GSSAPI-encrypted connection; if that fails or there are no credentials, try a non-GSSAPI-encrypted connection. This is the default when PostgreSQL has been compiled with GSSAPI support.

`require`  
only try a GSSAPI-encrypted connection

`gssencmode` is ignored for Unix domain socket communication. If PostgreSQL is compiled without GSSAPI support, using the `require` option will cause an error, while `prefer` will be accepted but libpq will not actually attempt a GSSAPI-encrypted connection.<span class="indexterm"></span>

`sslmode`  
This option determines whether or with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. There are six modes:

`disable`  
only try a non-SSL connection

`allow`  
first try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection

`prefer` (default)  
first try an SSL connection; if that fails, try a non-SSL connection

`require`  
only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify the certificate in the same way as if `verify-ca` was specified

`verify-ca`  
only try an SSL connection, and verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA)

`verify-full`  
only try an SSL connection, verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted CA and that the requested server host name matches that in the certificate

See [SSL Support](#libpq-ssl) for a detailed description of how these options work.

`sslmode` is ignored for Unix domain socket communication. If PostgreSQL is compiled without SSL support, using options `require`, `verify-ca`, or `verify-full` will cause an error, while options `allow` and `prefer` will be accepted but libpq will not actually attempt an SSL connection.<span class="indexterm"></span>

Note that if GSSAPI encryption is possible, that will be used in preference to SSL encryption, regardless of the value of `sslmode`. To force use of SSL encryption in an environment that has working GSSAPI infrastructure (such as a Kerberos server), also set `gssencmode` to `disable`.

`requiressl`  
This option is deprecated in favor of the `sslmode` setting.

If set to 1, an SSL connection to the server is required (this is equivalent to `sslmode` `require`). libpq will then refuse to connect if the server does not accept an SSL connection. If set to 0 (default), libpq will negotiate the connection type with the server (equivalent to `sslmode` `prefer`). This option is only available if PostgreSQL is compiled with SSL support.

`sslnegotiation`  
This option controls how SSL encryption is negotiated with the server, if SSL is used. In the default `postgres` mode, the client first asks the server if SSL is supported. In `direct` mode, the client starts the standard SSL handshake directly after establishing the TCP/IP connection. Traditional PostgreSQL protocol negotiation is the most flexible with different server configurations. If the server is known to support direct SSL connections then the latter requires one fewer round trip reducing connection latency and also allows the use of protocol agnostic SSL network tools. The direct SSL option was introduced in PostgreSQL version 17.

`postgres`  
perform PostgreSQL protocol negotiation. This is the default if the option is not provided.

`direct`  
start SSL handshake directly after establishing the TCP/IP connection. This is only allowed with sslmode=require or higher, because the weaker settings could lead to unintended fallback to plaintext authentication when the server does not support direct SSL handshake.

`sslcompression`  
If set to 1, data sent over SSL connections will be compressed. If set to 0, compression will be disabled. The default is 0. This parameter is ignored if a connection without SSL is made.

SSL compression is nowadays considered insecure and its use is no longer recommended. OpenSSL 1.1.0 disabled compression by default, and many operating system distributions disabled it in prior versions as well, so setting this parameter to on will not have any effect if the server does not accept compression. PostgreSQL 14 disabled compression completely in the backend.

If security is not a primary concern, compression can improve throughput if the network is the bottleneck. Disabling compression can improve response time and throughput if CPU performance is the limiting factor.

`sslcert`  
This parameter specifies the file name of the client SSL certificate, replacing the default `~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt`. This parameter is ignored if an SSL connection is not made.

`sslkey`  
This parameter specifies the location for the secret key used for the client certificate. It can either specify a file name that will be used instead of the default `~/.postgresql/postgresql.key`, or it can specify a key obtained from an external “engine” (engines are OpenSSL loadable modules). An external engine specification should consist of a colon-separated engine name and an engine-specific key identifier. This parameter is ignored if an SSL connection is not made.

`sslpassword`  
This parameter specifies the password for the secret key specified in `sslkey`, allowing client certificate private keys to be stored in encrypted form on disk even when interactive passphrase input is not practical.

Specifying this parameter with any non-empty value suppresses the `Enter PEM pass phrase:` prompt that OpenSSL will emit by default when an encrypted client certificate key is provided to `libpq`.

If the key is not encrypted this parameter is ignored. The parameter has no effect on keys specified by OpenSSL engines unless the engine uses the OpenSSL password callback mechanism for prompts.

There is no environment variable equivalent to this option, and no facility for looking it up in `.pgpass`. It can be used in a service file connection definition. Users with more sophisticated uses should consider using OpenSSL engines and tools like PKCS#11 or USB crypto offload devices.

`sslcertmode`  
This option determines whether a client certificate may be sent to the server, and whether the server is required to request one. There are three modes:

`disable`  
A client certificate is never sent, even if one is available (default location or provided via [sslcert](#libpq-connect-sslcert)).

`allow` (default)  
A certificate may be sent, if the server requests one and the client has one to send.

`require`  
The server *must* request a certificate. The connection will fail if the client does not send a certificate and the server successfully authenticates the client anyway.

> [!NOTE]
> `sslcertmode=require` doesn't add any additional security, since there is no guarantee that the server is validating the certificate correctly; PostgreSQL servers generally request TLS certificates from clients whether they validate them or not. The option may be useful when troubleshooting more complicated TLS setups.

`sslrootcert`  
This parameter specifies the name of a file containing SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate(s). If the file exists, the server's certificate will be verified to be signed by one of these authorities. The default is `~/.postgresql/root.crt`.

The special value `system` may be specified instead, in which case the trusted CA roots from the SSL implementation will be loaded. The exact locations of these root certificates differ by SSL implementation and platform. For OpenSSL in particular, the locations may be further modified by the `SSL_CERT_DIR` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variables.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `sslrootcert=system`, the default `sslmode` is changed to `verify-full`, and any weaker setting will result in an error. In most cases it is trivial for anyone to obtain a certificate trusted by the system for a hostname they control, rendering `verify-ca` and all weaker modes useless.
>
> The magic `system` value will take precedence over a local certificate file with the same name. If for some reason you find yourself in this situation, use an alternative path like `sslrootcert=./system` instead.

`sslcrl`  
This parameter specifies the file name of the SSL server certificate revocation list (CRL). Certificates listed in this file, if it exists, will be rejected while attempting to authenticate the server's certificate. If neither [sslcrl](#libpq-connect-sslcrl) nor [sslcrldir](#libpq-connect-sslcrldir) is set, this setting is taken as `~/.postgresql/root.crl`.

`sslcrldir`  
This parameter specifies the directory name of the SSL server certificate revocation list (CRL). Certificates listed in the files in this directory, if it exists, will be rejected while attempting to authenticate the server's certificate.

The directory needs to be prepared with the OpenSSL command `openssl rehash` or `c_rehash`. See its documentation for details.

Both `sslcrl` and `sslcrldir` can be specified together.

`sslsni`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
If set to 1 (default), libpq sets the TLS extension “Server Name Indication” (SNI) on SSL-enabled connections. By setting this parameter to 0, this is turned off.

The Server Name Indication can be used by SSL-aware proxies to route connections without having to decrypt the SSL stream. (Note that unless the proxy is aware of the PostgreSQL protocol handshake this would require setting `sslnegotiation` to `direct`.) However, SNI makes the destination host name appear in cleartext in the network traffic, so it might be undesirable in some cases.

`requirepeer`  
This parameter specifies the operating-system user name of the server, for example `requirepeer=postgres`. When making a Unix-domain socket connection, if this parameter is set, the client checks at the beginning of the connection that the server process is running under the specified user name; if it is not, the connection is aborted with an error. This parameter can be used to provide server authentication similar to that available with SSL certificates on TCP/IP connections. (Note that if the Unix-domain socket is in `/tmp` or another publicly writable location, any user could start a server listening there. Use this parameter to ensure that you are connected to a server run by a trusted user.) This option is only supported on platforms for which the `peer` authentication method is implemented; see [???](#auth-peer).

`ssl_min_protocol_version`  
This parameter specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol version to allow for the connection. Valid values are `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`. The supported protocols depend on the version of OpenSSL used, older versions not supporting the most modern protocol versions. If not specified, the default is `TLSv1.2`, which satisfies industry best practices as of this writing.

`ssl_max_protocol_version`  
This parameter specifies the maximum SSL/TLS protocol version to allow for the connection. Valid values are `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`. The supported protocols depend on the version of OpenSSL used, older versions not supporting the most modern protocol versions. If not set, this parameter is ignored and the connection will use the maximum bound defined by the backend, if set. Setting the maximum protocol version is mainly useful for testing or if some component has issues working with a newer protocol.

`krbsrvname`  
Kerberos service name to use when authenticating with GSSAPI. This must match the service name specified in the server configuration for Kerberos authentication to succeed. (See also [???](#gssapi-auth).) The default value is normally `postgres`, but that can be changed when building PostgreSQL via the `--with-krb-srvnam` option of configure. In most environments, this parameter never needs to be changed. Some Kerberos implementations might require a different service name, such as Microsoft Active Directory which requires the service name to be in upper case (`POSTGRES`).

`gsslib`  
GSS library to use for GSSAPI authentication. Currently this is disregarded except on Windows builds that include both GSSAPI and SSPI support. In that case, set this to `gssapi` to cause libpq to use the GSSAPI library for authentication instead of the default SSPI.

`gssdelegation`  
Forward (delegate) GSS credentials to the server. The default is `0` which means credentials will not be forwarded to the server. Set this to `1` to have credentials forwarded when possible.

`service`  
Service name to use for additional parameters. It specifies a service name in `pg_service.conf` that holds additional connection parameters. This allows applications to specify only a service name so connection parameters can be centrally maintained. See [The Connection Service File](#libpq-pgservice).

`target_session_attrs`  
This option determines whether the session must have certain properties to be acceptable. It's typically used in combination with multiple host names to select the first acceptable alternative among several hosts. There are six modes:

`any` (default)  
any successful connection is acceptable

`read-write`  
session must accept read-write transactions by default (that is, the server must not be in hot standby mode and the `default_transaction_read_only` parameter must be `off`)

`read-only`  
session must not accept read-write transactions by default (the converse)

`primary`  
server must not be in hot standby mode

`standby`  
server must be in hot standby mode

`prefer-standby`  
first try to find a standby server, but if none of the listed hosts is a standby server, try again in `any` mode

`load_balance_hosts`  
Controls the order in which the client tries to connect to the available hosts and addresses. Once a connection attempt is successful no other hosts and addresses will be tried. This parameter is typically used in combination with multiple host names or a DNS record that returns multiple IPs. This parameter can be used in combination with [target_session_attrs](#libpq-connect-target-session-attrs) to, for example, load balance over standby servers only. Once successfully connected, subsequent queries on the returned connection will all be sent to the same server. There are currently two modes:

`disable` (default)  
No load balancing across hosts is performed. Hosts are tried in the order in which they are provided and addresses are tried in the order they are received from DNS or a hosts file.

`random`  
Hosts and addresses are tried in random order. This value is mostly useful when opening multiple connections at the same time, possibly from different machines. This way connections can be load balanced across multiple PostgreSQL servers.

While random load balancing, due to its random nature, will almost never result in a completely uniform distribution, it statistically gets quite close. One important aspect here is that this algorithm uses two levels of random choices: First the hosts will be resolved in random order. Then secondly, before resolving the next host, all resolved addresses for the current host will be tried in random order. This behaviour can skew the amount of connections each node gets greatly in certain cases, for instance when some hosts resolve to more addresses than others. But such a skew can also be used on purpose, e.g. to increase the number of connections a larger server gets by providing its hostname multiple times in the host string.

When using this value it's recommended to also configure a reasonable value for [connect_timeout](#libpq-connect-connect-timeout). Because then, if one of the nodes that are used for load balancing is not responding, a new node will be tried.

## Connection Status Functions

These functions can be used to interrogate the status of an existing database connection object.

> [!TIP]
> <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span> libpq application programmers should be careful to maintain the PGconn abstraction. Use the accessor functions described below to get at the contents of PGconn. Reference to internal PGconn fields using `libpq-int.h` is not recommended because they are subject to change in the future.

The following functions return parameter values established at connection. These values are fixed for the life of the connection. If a multi-host connection string is used, the values of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhost), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQport), and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpass) can change if a new connection is established using the same PGconn object. Other values are fixed for the lifetime of the PGconn object.

`PQdb`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the database name of the connection. char \*PQdb(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQuser`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the user name of the connection. char \*PQuser(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQpass`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the password of the connection. char \*PQpass(const PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpass) will return either the password specified in the connection parameters, or if there was none and the password was obtained from the [password file](#libpq-pgpass), it will return that. In the latter case, if multiple hosts were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpass) until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using the function [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus).

`PQhost`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the server host name of the active connection. This can be a host name, an IP address, or a directory path if the connection is via Unix socket. (The path case can be distinguished because it will always be an absolute path, beginning with `/`.) char \*PQhost(const PGconn \*conn);

If the connection parameters specified both `host` and `hostaddr`, then [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhost) will return the `host` information. If only `hostaddr` was specified, then that is returned. If multiple hosts were specified in the connection parameters, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhost) returns the host actually connected to.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhost) returns `NULL` if the `conn` argument is `NULL`. Otherwise, if there is an error producing the host information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was an error), it returns an empty string.

If multiple hosts were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhost) until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using the function [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus).

`PQhostaddr`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the server IP address of the active connection. This can be the address that a host name resolved to, or an IP address provided through the `hostaddr` parameter. char \*PQhostaddr(const PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQhostaddr) returns `NULL` if the `conn` argument is `NULL`. Otherwise, if there is an error producing the host information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was an error), it returns an empty string.

`PQport`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the port of the active connection. char \*PQport(const PGconn \*conn);

If multiple ports were specified in the connection parameters, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQport) returns the port actually connected to.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQport) returns `NULL` if the `conn` argument is `NULL`. Otherwise, if there is an error producing the port information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was an error), it returns an empty string.

If multiple ports were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQport) until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using the function [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQstatus).

`PQtty`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
This function no longer does anything, but it remains for backwards compatibility. The function always return an empty string, or `NULL` if the `conn` argument is `NULL`. char \*PQtty(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQoptions`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the command-line options passed in the connection request. char \*PQoptions(const PGconn \*conn);

The following functions return status data that can change as operations are executed on the PGconn object.

`PQstatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the status of the connection. ConnStatusType PQstatus(const PGconn \*conn);

The status can be one of a number of values. However, only two of these are seen outside of an asynchronous connection procedure: `CONNECTION_OK` and `CONNECTION_BAD`. A good connection to the database has the status `CONNECTION_OK`. A failed connection attempt is signaled by status `CONNECTION_BAD`. Ordinarily, an OK status will remain so until [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish), but a communications failure might result in the status changing to `CONNECTION_BAD` prematurely. In that case the application could try to recover by calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQreset).

See the entry for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectStartParams), `PQconnectStart` and `PQconnectPoll` with regards to other status codes that might be returned.

`PQtransactionStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the current in-transaction status of the server. PGTransactionStatusType PQtransactionStatus(const PGconn \*conn); The status can be `PQTRANS_IDLE` (currently idle), `PQTRANS_ACTIVE` (a command is in progress), `PQTRANS_INTRANS` (idle, in a valid transaction block), or `PQTRANS_INERROR` (idle, in a failed transaction block). `PQTRANS_UNKNOWN` is reported if the connection is bad. `PQTRANS_ACTIVE` is reported only when a query has been sent to the server and not yet completed.

`PQparameterStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Looks up a current parameter setting of the server. const char \*PQparameterStatus(const PGconn \*conn, const char \*paramName); Certain parameter values are reported by the server automatically at connection startup or whenever their values change. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQparameterStatus) can be used to interrogate these settings. It returns the current value of a parameter if known, or `NULL` if the parameter is not known.

Parameters reported as of the current release include: `application_name`, `client_encoding`, `DateStyle`, `default_transaction_read_only`, `in_hot_standby`, `integer_datetimes`, `IntervalStyle`, `is_superuser`, `scram_iterations`, `server_encoding`, `server_version`, `session_authorization`, `standard_conforming_strings`, `TimeZone` (`default_transaction_read_only` and `in_hot_standby` were not reported by releases before 14; `scram_iterations` was not reported by releases before 16.) Note that `server_version`, `server_encoding` and `integer_datetimes` cannot change after startup.

If no value for `standard_conforming_strings` is reported, applications can assume it is `off`, that is, backslashes are treated as escapes in string literals. Also, the presence of this parameter can be taken as an indication that the escape string syntax (`E'...'`) is accepted.

Although the returned pointer is declared `const`, it in fact points to mutable storage associated with the `PGconn` structure. It is unwise to assume the pointer will remain valid across queries.

`PQprotocolVersion`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Interrogates the frontend/backend protocol being used. int PQprotocolVersion(const PGconn \*conn); Applications might wish to use this function to determine whether certain features are supported. Currently, the possible values are 3 (3.0 protocol), or zero (connection bad). The protocol version will not change after connection startup is complete, but it could theoretically change during a connection reset. The 3.0 protocol is supported by PostgreSQL server versions 7.4 and above.

`PQserverVersion`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns an integer representing the server version. int PQserverVersion(const PGconn \*conn);

Applications might use this function to determine the version of the database server they are connected to. The result is formed by multiplying the server's major version number by 10000 and adding the minor version number. For example, version 10.1 will be returned as 100001, and version 11.0 will be returned as 110000. Zero is returned if the connection is bad.

Prior to major version 10, PostgreSQL used three-part version numbers in which the first two parts together represented the major version. For those versions, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQserverVersion) uses two digits for each part; for example version 9.1.5 will be returned as 90105, and version 9.2.0 will be returned as 90200.

Therefore, for purposes of determining feature compatibility, applications should divide the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQserverVersion) by 100 not 10000 to determine a logical major version number. In all release series, only the last two digits differ between minor releases (bug-fix releases).

`PQerrorMessage`<span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the error message most recently generated by an operation on the connection. char \*PQerrorMessage(const PGconn \*conn);

Nearly all libpq functions will set a message for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) if they fail. Note that by libpq convention, a nonempty [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) result can consist of multiple lines, and will include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGconn handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish). The result string should not be expected to remain the same across operations on the `PGconn` structure.

`PQsocket`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Obtains the file descriptor number of the connection socket to the server. A valid descriptor will be greater than or equal to 0; a result of -1 indicates that no server connection is currently open. (This will not change during normal operation, but could change during connection setup or reset.) int PQsocket(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQbackendPID`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the process ID (PID)<span class="indexterm"></span> of the backend process handling this connection. int PQbackendPID(const PGconn \*conn);

The backend PID is useful for debugging purposes and for comparison to `NOTIFY` messages (which include the PID of the notifying backend process). Note that the PID belongs to a process executing on the database server host, not the local host!

`PQconnectionNeedsPassword`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method required a password, but none was available. Returns false (0) if not. int PQconnectionNeedsPassword(const PGconn \*conn);

This function can be applied after a failed connection attempt to decide whether to prompt the user for a password.

`PQconnectionUsedPassword`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method used a password. Returns false (0) if not. int PQconnectionUsedPassword(const PGconn \*conn);

This function can be applied after either a failed or successful connection attempt to detect whether the server demanded a password.

`PQconnectionUsedGSSAPI`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method used GSSAPI. Returns false (0) if not. int PQconnectionUsedGSSAPI(const PGconn \*conn);

This function can be applied to detect whether the connection was authenticated with GSSAPI.

The following functions return information related to SSL. This information usually doesn't change after a connection is established.

`PQsslInUse`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns true (1) if the connection uses SSL, false (0) if not. int PQsslInUse(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQsslAttribute`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns SSL-related information about the connection. const char \*PQsslAttribute(const PGconn \*conn, const char \*attribute_name);

The list of available attributes varies depending on the SSL library being used and the type of connection. Returns NULL if the connection does not use SSL or the specified attribute name is not defined for the library in use.

The following attributes are commonly available:

`library`  
Name of the SSL implementation in use. (Currently, only `"OpenSSL"` is implemented)

`protocol`  
SSL/TLS version in use. Common values are `"TLSv1"`, `"TLSv1.1"` and `"TLSv1.2"`, but an implementation may return other strings if some other protocol is used.

`key_bits`  
Number of key bits used by the encryption algorithm.

`cipher`  
A short name of the ciphersuite used, e.g., `"DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA"`. The names are specific to each SSL implementation.

`compression`  
Returns "on" if SSL compression is in use, else it returns "off".

`alpn`  
Application protocol selected by the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension. The only protocol supported by libpq is `postgresql`, so this is mainly useful for checking whether the server supported ALPN or not. Empty string if ALPN was not used.

As a special case, the `library` attribute may be queried without a connection by passing NULL as the `conn` argument. The result will be the default SSL library name, or NULL if libpq was compiled without any SSL support. (Prior to PostgreSQL version 15, passing NULL as the `conn` argument always resulted in NULL. Client programs needing to differentiate between the newer and older implementations of this case may check the `LIBPQ_HAS_SSL_LIBRARY_DETECTION` feature macro.)

`PQsslAttributeNames`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns an array of SSL attribute names that can be used in `PQsslAttribute()`. The array is terminated by a NULL pointer. const char \* const \* PQsslAttributeNames(const PGconn \*conn);

If `conn` is NULL, the attributes available for the default SSL library are returned, or an empty list if libpq was compiled without any SSL support. If `conn` is not NULL, the attributes available for the SSL library in use for the connection are returned, or an empty list if the connection is not encrypted.

`PQsslStruct`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns a pointer to an SSL-implementation-specific object describing the connection. Returns NULL if the connection is not encrypted or the requested type of object is not available from the connection's SSL implementation. void \*PQsslStruct(const PGconn \*conn, const char \*struct_name);

The struct(s) available depend on the SSL implementation in use. For OpenSSL, there is one struct, available under the name `OpenSSL`, and it returns a pointer to OpenSSL's `SSL` struct. To use this function, code along the following lines could be used:

    #include <libpq-fe.h>
    #include <openssl/ssl.h>

    ...

        SSL *ssl;

        dbconn = PQconnectdb(...);
        ...

        ssl = PQsslStruct(dbconn, "OpenSSL");
        if (ssl)
        {
            /* use OpenSSL functions to access ssl */
        }

This structure can be used to verify encryption levels, check server certificates, and more. Refer to the OpenSSL documentation for information about this structure.

`PQgetssl`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
<span class="indexterm"></span> Returns the SSL structure used in the connection, or NULL if SSL is not in use. void \*PQgetssl(const PGconn \*conn);

This function is equivalent to `PQsslStruct(conn, "OpenSSL")`. It should not be used in new applications, because the returned struct is specific to OpenSSL and will not be available if another SSL implementation is used. To check if a connection uses SSL, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsslInUse) instead, and for more details about the connection, use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsslAttribute).

## Command Execution Functions

Once a connection to a database server has been successfully established, the functions described here are used to perform SQL queries and commands.

### Main Functions

`PQexec`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a command to the server and waits for the result. PGresult \*PQexec(PGconn \*conn, const char \*command);

Returns a PGresult pointer or possibly a null pointer. A non-null pointer will generally be returned except in out-of-memory conditions or serious errors such as inability to send the command to the server. The [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultStatus) function should be called to check the return value for any errors (including the value of a null pointer, in which case it will return `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR`). Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to get more information about such errors.

The command string can include multiple SQL commands (separated by semicolons). Multiple queries sent in a single [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) call are processed in a single transaction, unless there are explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` commands included in the query string to divide it into multiple transactions. (See [???](#protocol-flow-multi-statement) for more details about how the server handles multi-query strings.) Note however that the returned PGresult structure describes only the result of the last command executed from the string. Should one of the commands fail, processing of the string stops with it and the returned PGresult describes the error condition.

`PQexecParams`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a command to the server and waits for the result, with the ability to pass parameters separately from the SQL command text. PGresult \*PQexecParams(PGconn \*conn, const char \*command, int nParams, const Oid \*paramTypes, const char \* const \*paramValues, const int \*paramLengths, const int \*paramFormats, int resultFormat);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams) is like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec), but offers additional functionality: parameter values can be specified separately from the command string proper, and query results can be requested in either text or binary format.

The function arguments are:

`conn`  
The connection object to send the command through.

`command`  
The SQL command string to be executed. If parameters are used, they are referred to in the command string as `$1`, `$2`, etc.

`nParams`  
The number of parameters supplied; it is the length of the arrays `paramTypes[]`, `paramValues[]`, `paramLengths[]`, and `paramFormats[]`. (The array pointers can be `NULL` when `nParams` is zero.)

`paramTypes[]`  
Specifies, by OID, the data types to be assigned to the parameter symbols. If `paramTypes` is `NULL`, or any particular element in the array is zero, the server infers a data type for the parameter symbol in the same way it would do for an untyped literal string.

`paramValues[]`  
Specifies the actual values of the parameters. A null pointer in this array means the corresponding parameter is null; otherwise the pointer points to a zero-terminated text string (for text format) or binary data in the format expected by the server (for binary format).

`paramLengths[]`  
Specifies the actual data lengths of binary-format parameters. It is ignored for null parameters and text-format parameters. The array pointer can be null when there are no binary parameters.

`paramFormats[]`  
Specifies whether parameters are text (put a zero in the array entry for the corresponding parameter) or binary (put a one in the array entry for the corresponding parameter). If the array pointer is null then all parameters are presumed to be text strings.

Values passed in binary format require knowledge of the internal representation expected by the backend. For example, integers must be passed in network byte order. Passing `numeric` values requires knowledge of the server storage format, as implemented in `src/backend/utils/adt/numeric.c::numeric_send()` and `src/backend/utils/adt/numeric.c::numeric_recv()`.

`resultFormat`  
Specify zero to obtain results in text format, or one to obtain results in binary format. (There is not currently a provision to obtain different result columns in different formats, although that is possible in the underlying protocol.)

The primary advantage of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams) over [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) is that parameter values can be separated from the command string, thus avoiding the need for tedious and error-prone quoting and escaping.

Unlike [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams) allows at most one SQL command in the given string. (There can be semicolons in it, but not more than one nonempty command.) This is a limitation of the underlying protocol, but has some usefulness as an extra defense against SQL-injection attacks.

> [!TIP]
> Specifying parameter types via OIDs is tedious, particularly if you prefer not to hard-wire particular OID values into your program. However, you can avoid doing so even in cases where the server by itself cannot determine the type of the parameter, or chooses a different type than you want. In the SQL command text, attach an explicit cast to the parameter symbol to show what data type you will send. For example:
>
>     SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE x = $1::bigint;
>
> This forces parameter `$1` to be treated as `bigint`, whereas by default it would be assigned the same type as `x`. Forcing the parameter type decision, either this way or by specifying a numeric type OID, is strongly recommended when sending parameter values in binary format, because binary format has less redundancy than text format and so there is less chance that the server will detect a type mismatch mistake for you.

`PQprepare`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to create a prepared statement with the given parameters, and waits for completion. PGresult \*PQprepare(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName, const char \*query, int nParams, const Oid \*paramTypes);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQprepare) creates a prepared statement for later execution with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecPrepared). This feature allows commands to be executed repeatedly without being parsed and planned each time; see [???](#sql-prepare) for details.

The function creates a prepared statement named `stmtName` from the `query` string, which must contain a single SQL command. `stmtName` can be `""` to create an unnamed statement, in which case any pre-existing unnamed statement is automatically replaced; otherwise it is an error if the statement name is already defined in the current session. If any parameters are used, they are referred to in the query as `$1`, `$2`, etc. `nParams` is the number of parameters for which types are pre-specified in the array `paramTypes[]`. (The array pointer can be `NULL` when `nParams` is zero.) `paramTypes[]` specifies, by OID, the data types to be assigned to the parameter symbols. If `paramTypes` is `NULL`, or any particular element in the array is zero, the server assigns a data type to the parameter symbol in the same way it would do for an untyped literal string. Also, the query can use parameter symbols with numbers higher than `nParams`; data types will be inferred for these symbols as well. (See [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared) for a means to find out what data types were inferred.)

As with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec), the result is normally a PGresult object whose contents indicate server-side success or failure. A null result indicates out-of-memory or inability to send the command at all. Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to get more information about such errors.

Prepared statements for use with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecPrepared) can also be created by executing SQL [???](#sql-prepare) statements.

`PQexecPrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, and waits for the result. PGresult \*PQexecPrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName, int nParams, const char \* const \*paramValues, const int \*paramLengths, const int \*paramFormats, int resultFormat);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecPrepared) is like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams), but the command to be executed is specified by naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query string. This feature allows commands that will be used repeatedly to be parsed and planned just once, rather than each time they are executed. The statement must have been prepared previously in the current session.

The parameters are identical to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams), except that the name of a prepared statement is given instead of a query string, and the `paramTypes[]` parameter is not present (it is not needed since the prepared statement's parameter types were determined when it was created).

`PQdescribePrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified prepared statement, and waits for completion. PGresult \*PQdescribePrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared) allows an application to obtain information about a previously prepared statement.

`stmtName` can be `""` or `NULL` to reference the unnamed statement, otherwise it must be the name of an existing prepared statement. On success, a PGresult with status `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` is returned. The functions [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQnparams) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQparamtype) can be applied to this PGresult to obtain information about the parameters of the prepared statement, and the functions [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQnfields), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfname), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQftype), etc. provide information about the result columns (if any) of the statement.

`PQdescribePortal`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified portal, and waits for completion. PGresult \*PQdescribePortal(PGconn \*conn, const char \*portalName);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePortal) allows an application to obtain information about a previously created portal. (libpq does not provide any direct access to portals, but you can use this function to inspect the properties of a cursor created with a `DECLARE CURSOR` SQL command.)

`portalName` can be `""` or `NULL` to reference the unnamed portal, otherwise it must be the name of an existing portal. On success, a PGresult with status `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` is returned. The functions [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQnfields), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfname), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQftype), etc. can be applied to the PGresult to obtain information about the result columns (if any) of the portal.

`PQclosePrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to close the specified prepared statement, and waits for completion. PGresult \*PQclosePrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePrepared) allows an application to close a previously prepared statement. Closing a statement releases all of its associated resources on the server and allows its name to be reused.

`stmtName` can be `""` or `NULL` to reference the unnamed statement. It is fine if no statement exists with this name, in that case the operation is a no-op. On success, a PGresult with status `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` is returned.

`PQclosePortal`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to close the specified portal, and waits for completion. PGresult \*PQclosePortal(PGconn \*conn, const char \*portalName);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePortal) allows an application to trigger a close of a previously created portal. Closing a portal releases all of its associated resources on the server and allows its name to be reused. (libpq does not provide any direct access to portals, but you can use this function to close a cursor created with a `DECLARE CURSOR` SQL command.)

`portalName` can be `""` or `NULL` to reference the unnamed portal. It is fine if no portal exists with this name, in that case the operation is a no-op. On success, a PGresult with status `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` is returned.

The PGresult<span class="indexterm"></span> structure encapsulates the result returned by the server. libpq application programmers should be careful to maintain the PGresult abstraction. Use the accessor functions below to get at the contents of PGresult. Avoid directly referencing the fields of the PGresult structure because they are subject to change in the future.

`PQresultStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the result status of the command. ExecStatusType PQresultStatus(const PGresult \*res);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultStatus) can return one of the following values:

`PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY`  
The string sent to the server was empty.

`PGRES_COMMAND_OK`  
Successful completion of a command returning no data.

`PGRES_TUPLES_OK`  
Successful completion of a command returning data (such as a `SELECT` or `SHOW`).

`PGRES_COPY_OUT`  
Copy Out (from server) data transfer started.

`PGRES_COPY_IN`  
Copy In (to server) data transfer started.

`PGRES_BAD_RESPONSE`  
The server's response was not understood.

`PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR`  
A nonfatal error (a notice or warning) occurred.

`PGRES_FATAL_ERROR`  
A fatal error occurred.

`PGRES_COPY_BOTH`  
Copy In/Out (to and from server) data transfer started. This feature is currently used only for streaming replication, so this status should not occur in ordinary applications.

`PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE`  
The PGresult contains a single result tuple from the current command. This status occurs only when single-row mode has been selected for the query (see [Retrieving Query Results in Chunks](#libpq-single-row-mode)).

`PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK`  
The PGresult contains several result tuples from the current command. This status occurs only when chunked mode has been selected for the query (see [Retrieving Query Results in Chunks](#libpq-single-row-mode)). The number of tuples will not exceed the limit passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetChunkedRowsMode).

`PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC`  
The PGresult represents a synchronization point in pipeline mode, requested by either [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpipelineSync) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendPipelineSync). This status occurs only when pipeline mode has been selected.

`PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED`  
The PGresult represents a pipeline that has received an error from the server. `PQgetResult` must be called repeatedly, and each time it will return this status code until the end of the current pipeline, at which point it will return `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC` and normal processing can resume.

If the result status is `PGRES_TUPLES_OK`, `PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE`, or `PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK`, then the functions described below can be used to retrieve the rows returned by the query. Note that a `SELECT` command that happens to retrieve zero rows still shows `PGRES_TUPLES_OK`. `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` is for commands that can never return rows (`INSERT` or `UPDATE` without a `RETURNING` clause, etc.). A response of `PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY` might indicate a bug in the client software.

A result of status `PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR` will never be returned directly by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) or other query execution functions; results of this kind are instead passed to the notice processor (see [Notice Processing](#libpq-notice-processing)).

`PQresStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Converts the enumerated type returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultStatus) into a string constant describing the status code. The caller should not free the result. char \*PQresStatus(ExecStatusType status);

`PQresultErrorMessage`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the error message associated with the command, or an empty string if there was no error. char \*PQresultErrorMessage(const PGresult \*res); If there was an error, the returned string will include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear).

Immediately following a [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) call, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) (on the connection) will return the same string as [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage) (on the result). However, a PGresult will retain its error message until destroyed, whereas the connection's error message will change when subsequent operations are done. Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage) when you want to know the status associated with a particular PGresult; use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) when you want to know the status from the latest operation on the connection.

`PQresultVerboseErrorMessage`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns a reformatted version of the error message associated with a PGresult object. char \*PQresultVerboseErrorMessage(const PGresult \*res, PGVerbosity verbosity, PGContextVisibility show_context); In some situations a client might wish to obtain a more detailed version of a previously-reported error. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultVerboseErrorMessage) addresses this need by computing the message that would have been produced by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage) if the specified verbosity settings had been in effect for the connection when the given PGresult was generated. If the PGresult is not an error result, “PGresult is not an error result” is reported instead. The returned string includes a trailing newline.

Unlike most other functions for extracting data from a PGresult, the result of this function is a freshly allocated string. The caller must free it using `PQfreemem()` when the string is no longer needed.

A NULL return is possible if there is insufficient memory.

`PQresultErrorField`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns an individual field of an error report. char \*PQresultErrorField(const PGresult \*res, int fieldcode); `fieldcode` is an error field identifier; see the symbols listed below. `NULL` is returned if the PGresult is not an error or warning result, or does not include the specified field. Field values will normally not include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear).

The following field codes are available:

`PG_DIAG_SEVERITY`  
The severity; the field contents are `ERROR`, `FATAL`, or `PANIC` (in an error message), or `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, or `LOG` (in a notice message), or a localized translation of one of these. Always present.

`PG_DIAG_SEVERITY_NONLOCALIZED`  
The severity; the field contents are `ERROR`, `FATAL`, or `PANIC` (in an error message), or `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, or `LOG` (in a notice message). This is identical to the `PG_DIAG_SEVERITY` field except that the contents are never localized. This is present only in reports generated by PostgreSQL versions 9.6 and later.

`PG_DIAG_SQLSTATE`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
The SQLSTATE code for the error. The SQLSTATE code identifies the type of error that has occurred; it can be used by front-end applications to perform specific operations (such as error handling) in response to a particular database error. For a list of the possible SQLSTATE codes, see [???](#errcodes-appendix). This field is not localizable, and is always present.

`PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_PRIMARY`  
The primary human-readable error message (typically one line). Always present.

`PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_DETAIL`  
Detail: an optional secondary error message carrying more detail about the problem. Might run to multiple lines.

`PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_HINT`  
Hint: an optional suggestion what to do about the problem. This is intended to differ from detail in that it offers advice (potentially inappropriate) rather than hard facts. Might run to multiple lines.

`PG_DIAG_STATEMENT_POSITION`  
A string containing a decimal integer indicating an error cursor position as an index into the original statement string. The first character has index 1, and positions are measured in characters not bytes.

`PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_POSITION`  
This is defined the same as the `PG_DIAG_STATEMENT_POSITION` field, but it is used when the cursor position refers to an internally generated command rather than the one submitted by the client. The `PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_QUERY` field will always appear when this field appears.

`PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_QUERY`  
The text of a failed internally-generated command. This could be, for example, an SQL query issued by a PL/pgSQL function.

`PG_DIAG_CONTEXT`  
An indication of the context in which the error occurred. Presently this includes a call stack traceback of active procedural language functions and internally-generated queries. The trace is one entry per line, most recent first.

`PG_DIAG_SCHEMA_NAME`  
If the error was associated with a specific database object, the name of the schema containing that object, if any.

`PG_DIAG_TABLE_NAME`  
If the error was associated with a specific table, the name of the table. (Refer to the schema name field for the name of the table's schema.)

`PG_DIAG_COLUMN_NAME`  
If the error was associated with a specific table column, the name of the column. (Refer to the schema and table name fields to identify the table.)

`PG_DIAG_DATATYPE_NAME`  
If the error was associated with a specific data type, the name of the data type. (Refer to the schema name field for the name of the data type's schema.)

`PG_DIAG_CONSTRAINT_NAME`  
If the error was associated with a specific constraint, the name of the constraint. Refer to fields listed above for the associated table or domain. (For this purpose, indexes are treated as constraints, even if they weren't created with constraint syntax.)

`PG_DIAG_SOURCE_FILE`  
The file name of the source-code location where the error was reported.

`PG_DIAG_SOURCE_LINE`  
The line number of the source-code location where the error was reported.

`PG_DIAG_SOURCE_FUNCTION`  
The name of the source-code function reporting the error.

> [!NOTE]
> The fields for schema name, table name, column name, data type name, and constraint name are supplied only for a limited number of error types; see [???](#errcodes-appendix). Do not assume that the presence of any of these fields guarantees the presence of another field. Core error sources observe the interrelationships noted above, but user-defined functions may use these fields in other ways. In the same vein, do not assume that these fields denote contemporary objects in the current database.

The client is responsible for formatting displayed information to meet its needs; in particular it should break long lines as needed. Newline characters appearing in the error message fields should be treated as paragraph breaks, not line breaks.

Errors generated internally by libpq will have severity and primary message, but typically no other fields.

Note that error fields are only available from PGresult objects, not PGconn objects; there is no `PQerrorField` function.

`PQclear`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Frees the storage associated with a PGresult. Every command result should be freed via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) when it is no longer needed. void PQclear(PGresult \*res); If the argument is a `NULL` pointer, no operation is performed.

You can keep a PGresult object around for as long as you need it; it does not go away when you issue a new command, nor even if you close the connection. To get rid of it, you must call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). Failure to do this will result in memory leaks in your application.

### Retrieving Query Result Information

These functions are used to extract information from a PGresult object that represents a successful query result (that is, one that has status `PGRES_TUPLES_OK`, `PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE`, or `PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK`). They can also be used to extract information from a successful Describe operation: a Describe's result has all the same column information that actual execution of the query would provide, but it has zero rows. For objects with other status values, these functions will act as though the result has zero rows and zero columns.

`PQntuples`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the number of rows (tuples) in the query result. (Note that PGresult objects are limited to no more than `INT_MAX` rows, so an `int` result is sufficient.) int PQntuples(const PGresult \*res);

`PQnfields`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the number of columns (fields) in each row of the query result. int PQnfields(const PGresult \*res);

`PQfname`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the column name associated with the given column number. Column numbers start at 0. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). char \*PQfname(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

`NULL` is returned if the column number is out of range.

`PQfnumber`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the column number associated with the given column name. int PQfnumber(const PGresult \*res, const char \*column_name);

-1 is returned if the given name does not match any column.

The given name is treated like an identifier in an SQL command, that is, it is downcased unless double-quoted. For example, given a query result generated from the SQL command:

    SELECT 1 AS FOO, 2 AS "BAR";

we would have the results:

    PQfname(res, 0)              foo
    PQfname(res, 1)              BAR
    PQfnumber(res, "FOO")        0
    PQfnumber(res, "foo")        0
    PQfnumber(res, "BAR")        -1
    PQfnumber(res, "\"BAR\"")    1

`PQftable`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the OID of the table from which the given column was fetched. Column numbers start at 0. Oid PQftable(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

`InvalidOid` is returned if the column number is out of range, or if the specified column is not a simple reference to a table column. You can query the system table `pg_class` to determine exactly which table is referenced.

The type `Oid` and the constant `InvalidOid` will be defined when you include the libpq header file. They will both be some integer type.

`PQftablecol`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the column number (within its table) of the column making up the specified query result column. Query-result column numbers start at 0, but table columns have nonzero numbers. int PQftablecol(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

Zero is returned if the column number is out of range, or if the specified column is not a simple reference to a table column.

`PQfformat`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the format code indicating the format of the given column. Column numbers start at 0. int PQfformat(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

Format code zero indicates textual data representation, while format code one indicates binary representation. (Other codes are reserved for future definition.)

`PQftype`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the data type associated with the given column number. The integer returned is the internal OID number of the type. Column numbers start at 0. Oid PQftype(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

You can query the system table `pg_type` to obtain the names and properties of the various data types. The OIDs of the built-in data types are defined in the file `catalog/pg_type_d.h` in the PostgreSQL installation's `include` directory.

`PQfmod`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the type modifier of the column associated with the given column number. Column numbers start at 0. int PQfmod(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

The interpretation of modifier values is type-specific; they typically indicate precision or size limits. The value -1 is used to indicate “no information available”. Most data types do not use modifiers, in which case the value is always -1.

`PQfsize`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the size in bytes of the column associated with the given column number. Column numbers start at 0. int PQfsize(const PGresult \*res, int column_number);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfsize) returns the space allocated for this column in a database row, in other words the size of the server's internal representation of the data type. (Accordingly, it is not really very useful to clients.) A negative value indicates the data type is variable-length.

`PQbinaryTuples`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns 1 if the PGresult contains binary data and 0 if it contains text data. int PQbinaryTuples(const PGresult \*res);

This function is deprecated (except for its use in connection with `COPY`), because it is possible for a single PGresult to contain text data in some columns and binary data in others. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfformat) is preferred. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQbinaryTuples) returns 1 only if all columns of the result are binary (format 1).

`PQgetvalue`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns a single field value of one row of a PGresult. Row and column numbers start at 0. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). char \*PQgetvalue(const PGresult \*res, int row_number, int column_number);

For data in text format, the value returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue) is a null-terminated character string representation of the field value. For data in binary format, the value is in the binary representation determined by the data type's `typsend` and `typreceive` functions. (The value is actually followed by a zero byte in this case too, but that is not ordinarily useful, since the value is likely to contain embedded nulls.)

An empty string is returned if the field value is null. See [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetisnull) to distinguish null values from empty-string values.

The pointer returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue) points to storage that is part of the PGresult structure. One should not modify the data it points to, and one must explicitly copy the data into other storage if it is to be used past the lifetime of the PGresult structure itself.

`PQgetisnull`<span class="indexterm"></span><span class="indexterm"></span>  
Tests a field for a null value. Row and column numbers start at 0. int PQgetisnull(const PGresult \*res, int row_number, int column_number);

This function returns 1 if the field is null and 0 if it contains a non-null value. (Note that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue) will return an empty string, not a null pointer, for a null field.)

`PQgetlength`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the actual length of a field value in bytes. Row and column numbers start at 0. int PQgetlength(const PGresult \*res, int row_number, int column_number);

This is the actual data length for the particular data value, that is, the size of the object pointed to by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue). For text data format this is the same as `strlen()`. For binary format this is essential information. Note that one should *not* rely on [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfsize) to obtain the actual data length.

`PQnparams`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the number of parameters of a prepared statement. int PQnparams(const PGresult \*res);

This function is only useful when inspecting the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared). For other types of results it will return zero.

`PQparamtype`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the data type of the indicated statement parameter. Parameter numbers start at 0. Oid PQparamtype(const PGresult \*res, int param_number);

This function is only useful when inspecting the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared). For other types of results it will return zero.

`PQprint`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Prints out all the rows and, optionally, the column names to the specified output stream. void PQprint(FILE \*fout, /\* output stream \*/ const PGresult \*res, const PQprintOpt \*po); typedef struct { pqbool header; /\* print output field headings and row count \*/ pqbool align; /\* fill align the fields \*/ pqbool standard; /\* old brain dead format \*/ pqbool html3; /\* output HTML tables \*/ pqbool expanded; /\* expand tables \*/ pqbool pager; /\* use pager for output if needed \*/ char \*fieldSep; /\* field separator \*/ char \*tableOpt; /\* attributes for HTML table element \*/ char \*caption; /\* HTML table caption \*/ char \*\*fieldName; /\* null-terminated array of replacement field names \*/ } PQprintOpt;

This function was formerly used by psql to print query results, but this is no longer the case. Note that it assumes all the data is in text format.

### Retrieving Other Result Information

These functions are used to extract other information from PGresult objects.

`PQcmdStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the command status tag from the SQL command that generated the PGresult. char \*PQcmdStatus(PGresult \*res);

Commonly this is just the name of the command, but it might include additional data such as the number of rows processed. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear).

`PQcmdTuples`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the number of rows affected by the SQL command. char \*PQcmdTuples(PGresult \*res);

This function returns a string containing the number of rows affected by the SQL statement that generated the PGresult. This function can only be used following the execution of a `SELECT`, `CREATE TABLE AS`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `MOVE`, `FETCH`, or `COPY` statement, or an `EXECUTE` of a prepared query that contains an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE` statement. If the command that generated the PGresult was anything else, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcmdTuples) returns an empty string. The caller should not free the return value directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear).

`PQoidValue`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the OID<span class="indexterm"></span> of the inserted row, if the SQL command was an `INSERT` that inserted exactly one row into a table that has OIDs, or a `EXECUTE` of a prepared query containing a suitable `INSERT` statement. Otherwise, this function returns `InvalidOid`. This function will also return `InvalidOid` if the table affected by the `INSERT` statement does not contain OIDs. Oid PQoidValue(const PGresult \*res);

`PQoidStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
This function is deprecated in favor of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQoidValue) and is not thread-safe. It returns a string with the OID of the inserted row, while [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQoidValue) returns the OID value. char \*PQoidStatus(const PGresult \*res);

### Escaping Strings for Inclusion in SQL Commands

escaping strings

in libpq

`PQescapeLiteral`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
char \*PQescapeLiteral(PGconn \*conn, const char \*str, size_t length);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral) escapes a string for use within an SQL command. This is useful when inserting data values as literal constants in SQL commands. Certain characters (such as quotes and backslashes) must be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted specially by the SQL parser. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral) performs this operation.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral) returns an escaped version of the `str` parameter in memory allocated with `malloc()`. This memory should be freed using `PQfreemem()` when the result is no longer needed. A terminating zero byte is not required, and should not be counted in `length`. (If a terminating zero byte is found before `length` bytes are processed, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral) stops at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like `strncpy`.) The return string has all special characters replaced so that they can be properly processed by the PostgreSQL string literal parser. A terminating zero byte is also added. The single quotes that must surround PostgreSQL string literals are included in the result string.

On error, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral) returns `NULL` and a suitable message is stored in the `conn` object.

> [!TIP]
> It is especially important to do proper escaping when handling strings that were received from an untrustworthy source. Otherwise there is a security risk: you are vulnerable to “SQL injection” attacks wherein unwanted SQL commands are fed to your database.

Note that it is neither necessary nor correct to do escaping when a data value is passed as a separate parameter in [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams) or its sibling routines.

`PQescapeIdentifier`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
char \*PQescapeIdentifier(PGconn \*conn, const char \*str, size_t length);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeIdentifier) escapes a string for use as an SQL identifier, such as a table, column, or function name. This is useful when a user-supplied identifier might contain special characters that would otherwise not be interpreted as part of the identifier by the SQL parser, or when the identifier might contain upper case characters whose case should be preserved.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeIdentifier) returns a version of the `str` parameter escaped as an SQL identifier in memory allocated with `malloc()`. This memory must be freed using `PQfreemem()` when the result is no longer needed. A terminating zero byte is not required, and should not be counted in `length`. (If a terminating zero byte is found before `length` bytes are processed, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeIdentifier) stops at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like `strncpy`.) The return string has all special characters replaced so that it will be properly processed as an SQL identifier. A terminating zero byte is also added. The return string will also be surrounded by double quotes.

On error, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeIdentifier) returns `NULL` and a suitable message is stored in the `conn` object.

> [!TIP]
> As with string literals, to prevent SQL injection attacks, SQL identifiers must be escaped when they are received from an untrustworthy source.

`PQescapeStringConn`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
size_t PQescapeStringConn(PGconn \*conn, char \*to, const char \*from, size_t length, int \*error);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn) escapes string literals, much like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral). Unlike [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeLiteral), the caller is responsible for providing an appropriately sized buffer. Furthermore, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn) does not generate the single quotes that must surround PostgreSQL string literals; they should be provided in the SQL command that the result is inserted into. The parameter `from` points to the first character of the string that is to be escaped, and the `length` parameter gives the number of bytes in this string. A terminating zero byte is not required, and should not be counted in `length`. (If a terminating zero byte is found before `length` bytes are processed, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn) stops at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like `strncpy`.) `to` shall point to a buffer that is able to hold at least one more byte than twice the value of `length`, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Behavior is likewise undefined if the `to` and `from` strings overlap.

If the `error` parameter is not `NULL`, then `*error` is set to zero on success, nonzero on error. Presently the only possible error conditions involve invalid multibyte encoding in the source string. The output string is still generated on error, but it can be expected that the server will reject it as malformed. On error, a suitable message is stored in the `conn` object, whether or not `error` is `NULL`.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn) returns the number of bytes written to `to`, not including the terminating zero byte.

`PQescapeString`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeString) is an older, deprecated version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn). size_t PQescapeString (char \*to, const char \*from, size_t length);

The only difference from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn) is that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeString) does not take PGconn or `error` parameters. Because of this, it cannot adjust its behavior depending on the connection properties (such as character encoding) and therefore *it might give the wrong results*. Also, it has no way to report error conditions.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeString) can be used safely in client programs that work with only one PostgreSQL connection at a time (in this case it can find out what it needs to know “behind the scenes”). In other contexts it is a security hazard and should be avoided in favor of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn).

`PQescapeByteaConn`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Escapes binary data for use within an SQL command with the type `bytea`. As with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeStringConn), this is only used when inserting data directly into an SQL command string. unsigned char \*PQescapeByteaConn(PGconn \*conn, const unsigned char \*from, size_t from_length, size_t \*to_length);

Certain byte values must be escaped when used as part of a `bytea` literal in an SQL statement. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn) escapes bytes using either hex encoding or backslash escaping. See [???](#datatype-binary) for more information.

The `from` parameter points to the first byte of the string that is to be escaped, and the `from_length` parameter gives the number of bytes in this binary string. (A terminating zero byte is neither necessary nor counted.) The `to_length` parameter points to a variable that will hold the resultant escaped string length. This result string length includes the terminating zero byte of the result.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn) returns an escaped version of the `from` parameter binary string in memory allocated with `malloc()`. This memory should be freed using `PQfreemem()` when the result is no longer needed. The return string has all special characters replaced so that they can be properly processed by the PostgreSQL string literal parser, and the `bytea` input function. A terminating zero byte is also added. The single quotes that must surround PostgreSQL string literals are not part of the result string.

On error, a null pointer is returned, and a suitable error message is stored in the `conn` object. Currently, the only possible error is insufficient memory for the result string.

`PQescapeBytea`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea) is an older, deprecated version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn). unsigned char \*PQescapeBytea(const unsigned char \*from, size_t from_length, size_t \*to_length);

The only difference from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn) is that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea) does not take a PGconn parameter. Because of this, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea) can only be used safely in client programs that use a single PostgreSQL connection at a time (in this case it can find out what it needs to know “behind the scenes”). It *might give the wrong results* if used in programs that use multiple database connections (use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn) in such cases).

`PQunescapeBytea`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Converts a string representation of binary data into binary data the reverse of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea). This is needed when retrieving `bytea` data in text format, but not when retrieving it in binary format. unsigned char \*PQunescapeBytea(const unsigned char \*from, size_t \*to_length);

The `from` parameter points to a string such as might be returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue) when applied to a `bytea` column. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQunescapeBytea) converts this string representation into its binary representation. It returns a pointer to a buffer allocated with `malloc()`, or `NULL` on error, and puts the size of the buffer in `to_length`. The result must be freed using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem) when it is no longer needed.

This conversion is not exactly the inverse of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea), because the string is not expected to be “escaped” when received from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue). In particular this means there is no need for string quoting considerations, and so no need for a PGconn parameter.

## Asynchronous Command Processing

nonblocking connection

The [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) function is adequate for submitting commands in normal, synchronous applications. It has a few deficiencies, however, that can be of importance to some users:

- [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) waits for the command to be completed. The application might have other work to do (such as maintaining a user interface), in which case it won't want to block waiting for the response.

- Since the execution of the client application is suspended while it waits for the result, it is hard for the application to decide that it would like to try to cancel the ongoing command. (It can be done from a signal handler, but not otherwise.)

- [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) can return only one PGresult structure. If the submitted command string contains multiple SQL commands, all but the last PGresult are discarded by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec).

- [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) always collects the command's entire result, buffering it in a single PGresult. While this simplifies error-handling logic for the application, it can be impractical for results containing many rows.

Applications that do not like these limitations can instead use the underlying functions that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) is built from: [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult). There are also [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryParams), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendPrepare), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryPrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePortal), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePrepared), and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePortal), which can be used with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to duplicate the functionality of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQprepare), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecPrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePortal), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePrepared), and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePortal) respectively.

`PQsendQuery`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a command to the server without waiting for the result(s). 1 is returned if the command was successfully dispatched and 0 if not (in which case, use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to get more information about the failure). int PQsendQuery(PGconn \*conn, const char \*command); After successfully calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery), call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) one or more times to obtain the results. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) cannot be called again (on the same connection) until [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) has returned a null pointer, indicating that the command is done.

In pipeline mode, this function is disallowed.

`PQsendQueryParams`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a command and separate parameters to the server without waiting for the result(s). int PQsendQueryParams(PGconn \*conn, const char \*command, int nParams, const Oid \*paramTypes, const char \* const \*paramValues, const int \*paramLengths, const int \*paramFormats, int resultFormat); This is equivalent to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) except that query parameters can be specified separately from the query string. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams). Like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecParams), it allows only one command in the query string.

`PQsendPrepare`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a request to create a prepared statement with the given parameters, without waiting for completion. int PQsendPrepare(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName, const char \*query, int nParams, const Oid \*paramTypes); This is an asynchronous version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQprepare): it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to determine whether the server successfully created the prepared statement. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQprepare).

`PQsendQueryPrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, without waiting for the result(s). int PQsendQueryPrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName, int nParams, const char \* const \*paramValues, const int \*paramLengths, const int \*paramFormats, int resultFormat); This is similar to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryParams), but the command to be executed is specified by naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query string. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexecPrepared).

`PQsendDescribePrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified prepared statement, without waiting for completion. int PQsendDescribePrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName); This is an asynchronous version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared): it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the results. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePrepared).

`PQsendDescribePortal`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified portal, without waiting for completion. int PQsendDescribePortal(PGconn \*conn, const char \*portalName); This is an asynchronous version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePortal): it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the results. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQdescribePortal).

`PQsendClosePrepared`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to close the specified prepared statement, without waiting for completion. int PQsendClosePrepared(PGconn \*conn, const char \*stmtName); This is an asynchronous version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePrepared): it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the results. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePrepared).

`PQsendClosePortal`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Submits a request to close specified portal, without waiting for completion. int PQsendClosePortal(PGconn \*conn, const char \*portalName); This is an asynchronous version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePortal): it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the results. The function's parameters are handled identically to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclosePortal).

`PQgetResult`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Waits for the next result from a prior [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryParams), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendPrepare), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryPrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePortal), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePortal), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendPipelineSync), or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpipelineSync) call, and returns it. A null pointer is returned when the command is complete and there will be no more results. PGresult \*PQgetResult(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) must be called repeatedly until it returns a null pointer, indicating that the command is done. (If called when no command is active, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) will just return a null pointer at once.) Each non-null result from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) should be processed using the same PGresult accessor functions previously described. Don't forget to free each result object with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) when done with it. Note that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) will block only if a command is active and the necessary response data has not yet been read by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput).

In pipeline mode, `PQgetResult` will return normally unless an error occurs; for any subsequent query sent after the one that caused the error until (and excluding) the next synchronization point, a special result of type `PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED` will be returned, and a null pointer will be returned after it. When the pipeline synchronization point is reached, a result of type `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC` will be returned. The result of the next query after the synchronization point follows immediately (that is, no null pointer is returned after the synchronization point).

> [!NOTE]
> Even when [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultStatus) indicates a fatal error, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) should be called until it returns a null pointer, to allow libpq to process the error information completely.

Using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) solves one of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec)'s problems: If a command string contains multiple SQL commands, the results of those commands can be obtained individually. (This allows a simple form of overlapped processing, by the way: the client can be handling the results of one command while the server is still working on later queries in the same command string.)

Another frequently-desired feature that can be obtained with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) is retrieving large query results a limited number of rows at a time. This is discussed in [Retrieving Query Results in Chunks](#libpq-single-row-mode).

By itself, calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) will still cause the client to block until the server completes the next SQL command. This can be avoided by proper use of two more functions:

`PQconsumeInput`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
If input is available from the server, consume it. int PQconsumeInput(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) normally returns 1 indicating “no error”, but returns 0 if there was some kind of trouble (in which case [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) can be consulted). Note that the result does not say whether any input data was actually collected. After calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput), the application can check [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQisBusy) and/or `PQnotifies` to see if their state has changed.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) can be called even if the application is not prepared to deal with a result or notification just yet. The function will read available data and save it in a buffer, thereby causing a `select()` read-ready indication to go away. The application can thus use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) to clear the `select()` condition immediately, and then examine the results at leisure.

`PQisBusy`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns 1 if a command is busy, that is, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) would block waiting for input. A 0 return indicates that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) can be called with assurance of not blocking. int PQisBusy(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQisBusy) will not itself attempt to read data from the server; therefore [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) must be invoked first, or the busy state will never end.

A typical application using these functions will have a main loop that uses `select()` or `poll()` to wait for all the conditions that it must respond to. One of the conditions will be input available from the server, which in terms of `select()` means readable data on the file descriptor identified by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsocket). When the main loop detects input ready, it should call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) to read the input. It can then call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQisBusy), followed by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) if [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQisBusy) returns false (0). It can also call `PQnotifies` to detect `NOTIFY` messages (see [Asynchronous Notification](#libpq-notify)).

A client that uses [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery)/[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) can also attempt to cancel a command that is still being processed by the server; see [Canceling Queries in Progress](#libpq-cancel). But regardless of the return value of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking), the application must continue with the normal result-reading sequence using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult). A successful cancellation will simply cause the command to terminate sooner than it would have otherwise.

By using the functions described above, it is possible to avoid blocking while waiting for input from the database server. However, it is still possible that the application will block waiting to send output to the server. This is relatively uncommon but can happen if very long SQL commands or data values are sent. (It is much more probable if the application sends data via `COPY IN`, however.) To prevent this possibility and achieve completely nonblocking database operation, the following additional functions can be used.

`PQsetnonblocking`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets the nonblocking status of the connection. int PQsetnonblocking(PGconn \*conn, int arg);

Sets the state of the connection to nonblocking if `arg` is 1, or blocking if `arg` is 0. Returns 0 if OK, -1 if error.

In the nonblocking state, successful calls to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputnbytes), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputCopyData), and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy) will not block; their changes are stored in the local output buffer until they are flushed. Unsuccessful calls will return an error and must be retried.

Note that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) does not honor nonblocking mode; if it is called, it will act in blocking fashion anyway.

`PQisnonblocking`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the blocking status of the database connection. int PQisnonblocking(const PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 if the connection is set to nonblocking mode and 0 if blocking.

`PQflush`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Attempts to flush any queued output data to the server. Returns 0 if successful (or if the send queue is empty), -1 if it failed for some reason, or 1 if it was unable to send all the data in the send queue yet (this case can only occur if the connection is nonblocking). int PQflush(PGconn \*conn);

After sending any command or data on a nonblocking connection, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush). If it returns 1, wait for the socket to become read- or write-ready. If it becomes write-ready, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush) again. If it becomes read-ready, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput), then call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush) again. Repeat until [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush) returns 0. (It is necessary to check for read-ready and drain the input with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput), because the server can block trying to send us data, e.g., NOTICE messages, and won't read our data until we read its.) Once [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush) returns 0, wait for the socket to be read-ready and then read the response as described above.

## Pipeline Mode

libpq

pipeline mode

pipelining

in libpq

batch mode

in libpq

libpq pipeline mode allows applications to send a query without having to read the result of the previously sent query. Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will wait less for the server, since multiple queries/results can be sent/received in a single network transaction.

While pipeline mode provides a significant performance boost, writing clients using the pipeline mode is more complex because it involves managing a queue of pending queries and finding which result corresponds to which query in the queue.

Pipeline mode also generally consumes more memory on both the client and server, though careful and aggressive management of the send/receive queue can mitigate this. This applies whether or not the connection is in blocking or non-blocking mode.

While libpq's pipeline API was introduced in PostgreSQL 14, it is a client-side feature which doesn't require special server support and works on any server that supports the v3 extended query protocol. For more information see [???](#protocol-flow-pipelining).

### Using Pipeline Mode

To issue pipelines, the application must switch the connection into pipeline mode, which is done with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQenterPipelineMode). [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpipelineStatus) can be used to test whether pipeline mode is active. In pipeline mode, only [asynchronous operations](#libpq-async) that utilize the extended query protocol are permitted, command strings containing multiple SQL commands are disallowed, and so is `COPY`. Using synchronous command execution functions such as `PQfn`, `PQexec`, `PQexecParams`, `PQprepare`, `PQexecPrepared`, `PQdescribePrepared`, `PQdescribePortal`, `PQclosePrepared`, `PQclosePortal`, is an error condition. `PQsendQuery` is also disallowed, because it uses the simple query protocol. Once all dispatched commands have had their results processed, and the end pipeline result has been consumed, the application may return to non-pipelined mode with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexitPipelineMode).

> [!NOTE]
> It is best to use pipeline mode with libpq in [non-blocking mode](#libpq-PQsetnonblocking). If used in blocking mode it is possible for a client/server deadlock to occur. [^1]

#### Issuing Queries

After entering pipeline mode, the application dispatches requests using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryParams) or its prepared-query sibling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQueryPrepared). These requests are queued on the client-side until flushed to the server; this occurs when [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQpipelineSync) is used to establish a synchronization point in the pipeline, or when [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush) is called. The functions [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendPrepare), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePrepared), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendDescribePortal), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePrepared), and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendClosePortal) also work in pipeline mode. Result processing is described below.

The server executes statements, and returns results, in the order the client sends them. The server will begin executing the commands in the pipeline immediately, not waiting for the end of the pipeline. Note that results are buffered on the server side; the server flushes that buffer when a synchronization point is established with either `PQpipelineSync` or `PQsendPipelineSync`, or when `PQsendFlushRequest` is called. If any statement encounters an error, the server aborts the current transaction and does not execute any subsequent command in the queue until the next synchronization point; a `PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED` result is produced for each such command. (This remains true even if the commands in the pipeline would rollback the transaction.) Query processing resumes after the synchronization point.

It's fine for one operation to depend on the results of a prior one; for example, one query may define a table that the next query in the same pipeline uses. Similarly, an application may create a named prepared statement and execute it with later statements in the same pipeline.

#### Processing Results

To process the result of one query in a pipeline, the application calls `PQgetResult` repeatedly and handles each result until `PQgetResult` returns null. The result from the next query in the pipeline may then be retrieved using `PQgetResult` again and the cycle repeated. The application handles individual statement results as normal. When the results of all the queries in the pipeline have been returned, `PQgetResult` returns a result containing the status value `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC`

The client may choose to defer result processing until the complete pipeline has been sent, or interleave that with sending further queries in the pipeline; see [Interleaving Result Processing and Query Dispatch](#libpq-pipeline-interleave).

`PQgetResult` behaves the same as for normal asynchronous processing except that it may contain the new `PGresult` types `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC` and `PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED`. `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC` is reported exactly once for each `PQpipelineSync` or `PQsendPipelineSync` at the corresponding point in the pipeline. `PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED` is emitted in place of a normal query result for the first error and all subsequent results until the next `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC`; see [Error Handling](#libpq-pipeline-errors).

`PQisBusy`, `PQconsumeInput`, etc operate as normal when processing pipeline results. In particular, a call to `PQisBusy` in the middle of a pipeline returns 0 if the results for all the queries issued so far have been consumed.

libpq does not provide any information to the application about the query currently being processed (except that `PQgetResult` returns null to indicate that we start returning the results of next query). The application must keep track of the order in which it sent queries, to associate them with their corresponding results. Applications will typically use a state machine or a FIFO queue for this.

#### Error Handling

From the client's perspective, after `PQresultStatus` returns `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR`, the pipeline is flagged as aborted. `PQresultStatus` will report a `PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED` result for each remaining queued operation in an aborted pipeline. The result for `PQpipelineSync` or `PQsendPipelineSync` is reported as `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC` to signal the end of the aborted pipeline and resumption of normal result processing.

The client *must* process results with `PQgetResult` during error recovery.

If the pipeline used an implicit transaction, then operations that have already executed are rolled back and operations that were queued to follow the failed operation are skipped entirely. The same behavior holds if the pipeline starts and commits a single explicit transaction (i.e. the first statement is `BEGIN` and the last is `COMMIT`) except that the session remains in an aborted transaction state at the end of the pipeline. If a pipeline contains *multiple explicit transactions*, all transactions that committed prior to the error remain committed, the currently in-progress transaction is aborted, and all subsequent operations are skipped completely, including subsequent transactions. If a pipeline synchronization point occurs with an explicit transaction block in aborted state, the next pipeline will become aborted immediately unless the next command puts the transaction in normal mode with `ROLLBACK`.

> [!NOTE]
> The client must not assume that work is committed when it *sends* a `COMMIT` only when the corresponding result is received to confirm the commit is complete. Because errors arrive asynchronously, the application needs to be able to restart from the last *received* committed change and resend work done after that point if something goes wrong.

#### Interleaving Result Processing and Query Dispatch

To avoid deadlocks on large pipelines the client should be structured around a non-blocking event loop using operating system facilities such as `select`, `poll`, `WaitForMultipleObjectEx`, etc.

The client application should generally maintain a queue of work remaining to be dispatched and a queue of work that has been dispatched but not yet had its results processed. When the socket is writable it should dispatch more work. When the socket is readable it should read results and process them, matching them up to the next entry in its corresponding results queue. Based on available memory, results from the socket should be read frequently: there's no need to wait until the pipeline end to read the results. Pipelines should be scoped to logical units of work, usually (but not necessarily) one transaction per pipeline. There's no need to exit pipeline mode and re-enter it between pipelines, or to wait for one pipeline to finish before sending the next.

An example using `select()` and a simple state machine to track sent and received work is in `src/test/modules/libpq_pipeline/libpq_pipeline.c` in the PostgreSQL source distribution.

### Functions Associated with Pipeline Mode

`PQpipelineStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the current pipeline mode status of the libpq connection. PGpipelineStatus PQpipelineStatus(const PGconn \*conn);

`PQpipelineStatus` can return one of the following values:

`PQ_PIPELINE_ON`  
The libpq connection is in pipeline mode.

`PQ_PIPELINE_OFF`  
The libpq connection is *not* in pipeline mode.

`PQ_PIPELINE_ABORTED`  
The libpq connection is in pipeline mode and an error occurred while processing the current pipeline. The aborted flag is cleared when `PQgetResult` returns a result of type `PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC`.

`PQenterPipelineMode`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Causes a connection to enter pipeline mode if it is currently idle or already in pipeline mode. int PQenterPipelineMode(PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 and has no effect if the connection is not currently idle, i.e., it has a result ready, or it is waiting for more input from the server, etc. This function does not actually send anything to the server, it just changes the libpq connection state.

`PQexitPipelineMode`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Causes a connection to exit pipeline mode if it is currently in pipeline mode with an empty queue and no pending results. int PQexitPipelineMode(PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 for success. Returns 1 and takes no action if not in pipeline mode. If the current statement isn't finished processing, or `PQgetResult` has not been called to collect results from all previously sent query, returns 0 (in which case, use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to get more information about the failure).

`PQpipelineSync`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Marks a synchronization point in a pipeline by sending a [sync message](#protocol-flow-ext-query) and flushing the send buffer. This serves as the delimiter of an implicit transaction and an error recovery point; see [Error Handling](#libpq-pipeline-errors). int PQpipelineSync(PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 if the connection is not in pipeline mode or sending a [sync message](#protocol-flow-ext-query) failed.

`PQsendPipelineSync`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Marks a synchronization point in a pipeline by sending a [sync message](#protocol-flow-ext-query) without flushing the send buffer. This serves as the delimiter of an implicit transaction and an error recovery point; see [Error Handling](#libpq-pipeline-errors). int PQsendPipelineSync(PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 if the connection is not in pipeline mode or sending a [sync message](#protocol-flow-ext-query) failed. Note that the message is not itself flushed to the server automatically; use `PQflush` if necessary.

`PQsendFlushRequest`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a request for the server to flush its output buffer. int PQsendFlushRequest(PGconn \*conn);

Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 on any failure.

The server flushes its output buffer automatically as a result of `PQpipelineSync` being called, or on any request when not in pipeline mode; this function is useful to cause the server to flush its output buffer in pipeline mode without establishing a synchronization point. Note that the request is not itself flushed to the server automatically; use `PQflush` if necessary.

### When to Use Pipeline Mode

Much like asynchronous query mode, there is no meaningful performance overhead when using pipeline mode. It increases client application complexity, and extra caution is required to prevent client/server deadlocks, but pipeline mode can offer considerable performance improvements, in exchange for increased memory usage from leaving state around longer.

Pipeline mode is most useful when the server is distant, i.e., network latency (“ping time”) is high, and also when many small operations are being performed in rapid succession. There is usually less benefit in using pipelined commands when each query takes many multiples of the client/server round-trip time to execute. A 100-statement operation run on a server 300 ms round-trip-time away would take 30 seconds in network latency alone without pipelining; with pipelining it may spend as little as 0.3 s waiting for results from the server.

Use pipelined commands when your application does lots of small `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations that can't easily be transformed into operations on sets, or into a `COPY` operation.

Pipeline mode is not useful when information from one operation is required by the client to produce the next operation. In such cases, the client would have to introduce a synchronization point and wait for a full client/server round-trip to get the results it needs. However, it's often possible to adjust the client design to exchange the required information server-side. Read-modify-write cycles are especially good candidates; for example:

    BEGIN;
    SELECT x FROM mytable WHERE id = 42 FOR UPDATE;
    -- result: x=2
    -- client adds 1 to x:
    UPDATE mytable SET x = 3 WHERE id = 42;
    COMMIT;

could be much more efficiently done with:

    UPDATE mytable SET x = x + 1 WHERE id = 42;

Pipelining is less useful, and more complex, when a single pipeline contains multiple transactions (see [Error Handling](#libpq-pipeline-errors)).

## Retrieving Query Results in Chunks

libpq

single-row mode

libpq

chunked mode

Ordinarily, libpq collects an SQL command's entire result and returns it to the application as a single PGresult. This can be unworkable for commands that return a large number of rows. For such cases, applications can use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) in single-row mode or chunked mode. In these modes, result row(s) are returned to the application as they are received from the server, one at a time for single-row mode or in groups for chunked mode.

To enter one of these modes, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetSingleRowMode) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetChunkedRowsMode) immediately after a successful call of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) (or a sibling function). This mode selection is effective only for the currently executing query. Then call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) repeatedly, until it returns null, as documented in [Asynchronous Command Processing](#libpq-async). If the query returns any rows, they are returned as one or more PGresult objects, which look like normal query results except for having status code `PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE` for single-row mode or `PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK` for chunked mode, instead of `PGRES_TUPLES_OK`. There is exactly one result row in each `PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE` object, while a `PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK` object contains at least one row but not more than the specified number of rows per chunk. After the last row, or immediately if the query returns zero rows, a zero-row object with status `PGRES_TUPLES_OK` is returned; this is the signal that no more rows will arrive. (But note that it is still necessary to continue calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) until it returns null.) All of these PGresult objects will contain the same row description data (column names, types, etc.) that an ordinary PGresult object for the query would have. Each object should be freed with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) as usual.

When using pipeline mode, single-row or chunked mode needs to be activated for each query in the pipeline before retrieving results for that query with `PQgetResult`. See [Pipeline Mode](#libpq-pipeline-mode) for more information.

`PQsetSingleRowMode`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Select single-row mode for the currently-executing query. int PQsetSingleRowMode(PGconn \*conn);

This function can only be called immediately after [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) or one of its sibling functions, before any other operation on the connection such as [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult). If called at the correct time, the function activates single-row mode for the current query and returns 1. Otherwise the mode stays unchanged and the function returns 0. In any case, the mode reverts to normal after completion of the current query.

`PQsetChunkedRowsMode`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Select chunked mode for the currently-executing query. int PQsetChunkedRowsMode(PGconn \*conn, int chunkSize);

This function is similar to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetSingleRowMode), except that it specifies retrieval of up to \<chunkSize\> rows per PGresult, not necessarily just one row. This function can only be called immediately after [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery) or one of its sibling functions, before any other operation on the connection such as [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult). If called at the correct time, the function activates chunked mode for the current query and returns 1. Otherwise the mode stays unchanged and the function returns 0. In any case, the mode reverts to normal after completion of the current query.

> [!CAUTION]
> While processing a query, the server may return some rows and then encounter an error, causing the query to be aborted. Ordinarily, libpq discards any such rows and reports only the error. But in single-row or chunked mode, some rows may have already been returned to the application. Hence, the application will see some `PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE` or `PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK` PGresult objects followed by a `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR` object. For proper transactional behavior, the application must be designed to discard or undo whatever has been done with the previously-processed rows, if the query ultimately fails.

## Canceling Queries in Progress

canceling SQL queries

query cancellation

### Functions for Sending Cancel Requests

`PQcancelCreate`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Prepares a connection over which a cancel request can be sent. PGcancelConn \*PQcancelCreate(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelCreate) creates a PGcancelConn<span class="indexterm"></span> object, but it won't instantly start sending a cancel request over this connection. A cancel request can be sent over this connection in a blocking manner using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking) and in a non-blocking manner using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStart). The return value can be passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStatus) to check if the PGcancelConn object was created successfully. The PGcancelConn object is an opaque structure that is not meant to be accessed directly by the application. This PGcancelConn object can be used to cancel the query that's running on the original connection in a thread-safe way.

Many connection parameters of the original client will be reused when setting up the connection for the cancel request. Importantly, if the original connection requires encryption of the connection and/or verification of the target host (using `sslmode` or `gssencmode`), then the connection for the cancel request is made with these same requirements. Any connection options that are only used during authentication or after authentication of the client are ignored though, because cancellation requests do not require authentication and the connection is closed right after the cancellation request is submitted.

Note that when `PQcancelCreate` returns a non-null pointer, you must call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelFinish) when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of the structure and any associated memory blocks. This must be done even if the cancel request failed or was abandoned.

`PQcancelBlocking`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Requests that the server abandons processing of the current command in a blocking manner. int PQcancelBlocking(PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

The request is made over the given PGcancelConn, which needs to be created with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelCreate). The return value of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking) is 1 if the cancel request was successfully dispatched and 0 if not. If it was unsuccessful, the error message can be retrieved using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelErrorMessage).

Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, however. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the command), then there will be no visible result at all.

`PQcancelStart`<span class="indexterm"></span>; `PQcancelPoll`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Requests that the server abandons processing of the current command in a non-blocking manner. int PQcancelStart(PGcancelConn \*cancelConn); PostgresPollingStatusType PQcancelPoll(PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

The request is made over the given PGcancelConn, which needs to be created with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelCreate). The return value of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStart) is 1 if the cancellation request could be started and 0 if not. If it was unsuccessful, the error message can be retrieved using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelErrorMessage).

If `PQcancelStart` succeeds, the next stage is to poll libpq so that it can proceed with the cancel connection sequence. Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelSocket) to obtain the descriptor of the socket underlying the database connection. (Caution: do not assume that the socket remains the same across `PQcancelPoll` calls.) Loop thus: If `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)` last returned `PGRES_POLLING_READING`, wait until the socket is ready to read (as indicated by `select()`, `poll()`, or similar system function). Then call `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)` again. Conversely, if `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)` last returned `PGRES_POLLING_WRITING`, wait until the socket is ready to write, then call `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)` again. On the first iteration, i.e., if you have yet to call `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)`, behave as if it last returned `PGRES_POLLING_WRITING`. Continue this loop until `PQcancelPoll(cancelConn)` returns `PGRES_POLLING_FAILED`, indicating the connection procedure has failed, or `PGRES_POLLING_OK`, indicating cancel request was successfully dispatched.

Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, however. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the command), then there will be no visible result at all.

At any time during connection, the status of the connection can be checked by calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStatus). If this call returns `CONNECTION_BAD`, then the cancel procedure has failed; if the call returns `CONNECTION_OK`, then cancel request was successfully dispatched. Both of these states are equally detectable from the return value of `PQcancelPoll`, described above. Other states might also occur during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These indicate the current stage of the connection procedure and might be useful to provide feedback to the user for example. These statuses are:

`CONNECTION_ALLOCATED`  
Waiting for a call to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStart) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking), to actually open the socket. This is the connection state right after calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelCreate) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelReset). No connection to the server has been initiated yet at this point. To actually start sending the cancel request use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStart) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking).

`CONNECTION_STARTED`  
Waiting for connection to be made.

`CONNECTION_MADE`  
Connection OK; waiting to send.

`CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE`  
Waiting for a response from the server.

`CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP`  
Negotiating SSL encryption.

`CONNECTION_GSS_STARTUP`  
Negotiating GSS encryption.

Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain compatibility), an application should never rely upon these occurring in a particular order, or at all, or on the status always being one of these documented values. An application might do something like this:

    switch(PQcancelStatus(conn))
    {
            case CONNECTION_STARTED:
                feedback = "Connecting...";
                break;

            case CONNECTION_MADE:
                feedback = "Connected to server...";
                break;
    .
    .
    .
            default:
                feedback = "Connecting...";
    }

The `connect_timeout` connection parameter is ignored when using `PQcancelPoll`; it is the application's responsibility to decide whether an excessive amount of time has elapsed. Otherwise, `PQcancelStart` followed by a `PQcancelPoll` loop is equivalent to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking).

`PQcancelStatus`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the status of the cancel connection. ConnStatusType PQcancelStatus(const PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

The status can be one of a number of values. However, only three of these are seen outside of an asynchronous cancel procedure: `CONNECTION_ALLOCATED`, `CONNECTION_OK` and `CONNECTION_BAD`. The initial state of a `PGcancelConn` that's successfully created using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelCreate) is `CONNECTION_ALLOCATED`. A cancel request that was successfully dispatched has the status `CONNECTION_OK`. A failed cancel attempt is signaled by status `CONNECTION_BAD`. An OK status will remain so until [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelFinish) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelReset) is called.

See the entry for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStart) with regards to other status codes that might be returned.

Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, however. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the command), then there will be no visible result at all.

`PQcancelSocket`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Obtains the file descriptor number of the cancel connection socket to the server. int PQcancelSocket(const PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

A valid descriptor will be greater than or equal to 0; a result of -1 indicates that no server connection is currently open. This might change as a result of calling any of the functions in this section on the PGcancelConn (except for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelErrorMessage) and `PQcancelSocket` itself).

`PQcancelErrorMessage`<span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the error message most recently generated by an operation on the cancel connection. char \*PQcancelErrorMessage(const PGcancelConn \*cancelconn);

Nearly all libpq functions that take a PGcancelConn will set a message for [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelErrorMessage) if they fail. Note that by libpq convention, a nonempty [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelErrorMessage) result can consist of multiple lines, and will include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGcancelConn handle is passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelFinish). The result string should not be expected to remain the same across operations on the `PGcancelConn` structure.

`PQcancelFinish`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Closes the cancel connection (if it did not finish sending the cancel request yet). Also frees memory used by the PGcancelConn object. void PQcancelFinish(PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

Note that even if the cancel attempt fails (as indicated by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelStatus)), the application should call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelFinish) to free the memory used by the PGcancelConn object. The PGcancelConn pointer must not be used again after [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelFinish) has been called.

`PQcancelReset`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Resets the `PGcancelConn` so it can be reused for a new cancel connection. void PQcancelReset(PGcancelConn \*cancelConn);

If the `PGcancelConn` is currently used to send a cancel request, then this connection is closed. It will then prepare the `PGcancelConn` object such that it can be used to send a new cancel request.

This can be used to create one PGcancelConn for a PGconn and reuse it multiple times throughout the lifetime of the original PGconn.

### Obsolete Functions for Sending Cancel Requests

These functions represent older methods of sending cancel requests. Although they still work, they are deprecated due to not sending the cancel requests in an encrypted manner, even when the original connection specified `sslmode` or `gssencmode` to require encryption. Thus these older methods are heavily discouraged from being used in new code, and it is recommended to change existing code to use the new functions instead.

`PQgetCancel`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Creates a data structure containing the information needed to cancel a command using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel). PGcancel \*PQgetCancel(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCancel) creates a PGcancel<span class="indexterm"></span> object given a PGconn connection object. It will return `NULL` if the given `conn` is `NULL` or an invalid connection. The PGcancel object is an opaque structure that is not meant to be accessed directly by the application; it can only be passed to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreeCancel).

`PQfreeCancel`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Frees a data structure created by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCancel). void PQfreeCancel(PGcancel \*cancel);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreeCancel) frees a data object previously created by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCancel).

`PQcancel`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) is a deprecated and insecure variant of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking), but one that can be used safely from within a signal handler. int PQcancel(PGcancel \*cancel, char \*errbuf, int errbufsize);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) only exists because of backwards compatibility reasons. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking) should be used instead. The only benefit that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) has is that it can be safely invoked from a signal handler, if the `errbuf` is a local variable in the signal handler. However, this is generally not considered a big enough benefit to be worth the security issues that this function has.

The PGcancel object is read-only as far as [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) is concerned, so it can also be invoked from a thread that is separate from the one manipulating the PGconn object.

The return value of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancel) is 1 if the cancel request was successfully dispatched and 0 if not. If not, `errbuf` is filled with an explanatory error message. `errbuf` must be a char array of size `errbufsize` (the recommended size is 256 bytes).

<!-- -->

`PQrequestCancel`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQrequestCancel) is a deprecated and insecure variant of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking). int PQrequestCancel(PGconn \*conn);

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQrequestCancel) only exists because of backwards compatibility reasons. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking) should be used instead. There is no benefit to using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQrequestCancel) over [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking).

Requests that the server abandon processing of the current command. It operates directly on the PGconn object, and in case of failure stores the error message in the PGconn object (whence it can be retrieved by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage)). Although the functionality is the same, this approach is not safe within multiple-thread programs or signal handlers, since it is possible that overwriting the PGconn's error message will mess up the operation currently in progress on the connection.

## The Fast-Path Interface

fast path

PostgreSQL provides a fast-path interface to send simple function calls to the server.

> [!WARNING]
> This interface is unsafe and should not be used. When `result_is_int` is set to `0`, `PQfn` may write data beyond the end of `result_buf`, regardless of whether the buffer has enough space for the requested number of bytes. Furthermore, it is obsolete, as one can achieve similar performance and greater functionality by setting up a prepared statement to define the function call. Then, executing the statement with binary transmission of parameters and results substitutes for a fast-path function call.

The function `PQfn`<span class="indexterm"></span> requests execution of a server function via the fast-path interface: PGresult \*PQfn(PGconn \*conn, int fnid, int \*result_buf, int \*result_len, int result_is_int, const PQArgBlock \*args, int nargs); typedef struct { int len; int isint; union { int \*ptr; int integer; } u; } PQArgBlock;

The `fnid` argument is the OID of the function to be executed. `args` and `nargs` define the parameters to be passed to the function; they must match the declared function argument list. When the `isint` field of a parameter structure is true, the `u.integer` value is sent to the server as an integer of the indicated length (this must be 2 or 4 bytes); proper byte-swapping occurs. When `isint` is false, the indicated number of bytes at `*u.ptr` are sent with no processing; the data must be in the format expected by the server for binary transmission of the function's argument data type. (The declaration of `u.ptr` as being of type `int *` is historical; it would be better to consider it `void *`.) `result_buf` points to the buffer in which to place the function's return value. The caller must have allocated sufficient space to store the return value. (There is no check!) The actual result length in bytes will be returned in the integer pointed to by `result_len`. If a 2- or 4-byte integer result is expected, set `result_is_int` to 1, otherwise set it to 0. Setting `result_is_int` to 1 causes libpq to byte-swap the value if necessary, so that it is delivered as a proper `int` value for the client machine; note that a 4-byte integer is delivered into `*result_buf` for either allowed result size. When `result_is_int` is 0, the binary-format byte string sent by the server is returned unmodified. (In this case it's better to consider `result_buf` as being of type `void *`.)

`PQfn` always returns a valid PGresult pointer, with status `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` for success or `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR` if some problem was encountered. The result status should be checked before the result is used. The caller is responsible for freeing the PGresult with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) when it is no longer needed.

To pass a NULL argument to the function, set the `len` field of that parameter structure to `-1`; the `isint` and `u` fields are then irrelevant.

If the function returns NULL, `*result_len` is set to `-1`, and `*result_buf` is not modified.

Note that it is not possible to handle set-valued results when using this interface. Also, the function must be a plain function, not an aggregate, window function, or procedure.

## Asynchronous Notification

NOTIFY

in libpq

PostgreSQL offers asynchronous notification via the `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` commands. A client session registers its interest in a particular notification channel with the `LISTEN` command (and can stop listening with the `UNLISTEN` command). All sessions listening on a particular channel will be notified asynchronously when a `NOTIFY` command with that channel name is executed by any session. A “payload” string can be passed to communicate additional data to the listeners.

libpq applications submit `LISTEN`, `UNLISTEN`, and `NOTIFY` commands as ordinary SQL commands. The arrival of `NOTIFY` messages can subsequently be detected by calling `PQnotifies`.<span class="indexterm"></span>

The function `PQnotifies` returns the next notification from a list of unhandled notification messages received from the server. It returns a null pointer if there are no pending notifications. Once a notification is returned from `PQnotifies`, it is considered handled and will be removed from the list of notifications. PGnotify \*PQnotifies(PGconn \*conn); typedef struct pgNotify { char \*relname; /\* notification channel name \*/ int be_pid; /\* process ID of notifying server process \*/ char \*extra; /\* notification payload string \*/ } PGnotify; After processing a PGnotify object returned by `PQnotifies`, be sure to free it with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem). It is sufficient to free the PGnotify pointer; the relname and extra fields do not represent separate allocations. (The names of these fields are historical; in particular, channel names need not have anything to do with relation names.)

[example_title](#libpq-example-2) gives a sample program that illustrates the use of asynchronous notification.

`PQnotifies` does not actually read data from the server; it just returns messages previously absorbed by another libpq function. In ancient releases of libpq, the only way to ensure timely receipt of `NOTIFY` messages was to constantly submit commands, even empty ones, and then check `PQnotifies` after each [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec). While this still works, it is deprecated as a waste of processing power.

A better way to check for `NOTIFY` messages when you have no useful commands to execute is to call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput), then check `PQnotifies`. You can use `select()` to wait for data to arrive from the server, thereby using no CPU power unless there is something to do. (See [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsocket) to obtain the file descriptor number to use with `select()`.) Note that this will work OK whether you submit commands with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsendQuery)/[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) or simply use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec). You should, however, remember to check `PQnotifies` after each [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec), to see if any notifications came in during the processing of the command.

## Functions Associated with the `COPY` Command

COPY

with libpq

The `COPY` command in PostgreSQL has options to read from or write to the network connection used by libpq. The functions described in this section allow applications to take advantage of this capability by supplying or consuming copied data.

The overall process is that the application first issues the SQL `COPY` command via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) or one of the equivalent functions. The response to this (if there is no error in the command) will be a PGresult object bearing a status code of `PGRES_COPY_OUT` or `PGRES_COPY_IN` (depending on the specified copy direction). The application should then use the functions of this section to receive or transmit data rows. When the data transfer is complete, another PGresult object is returned to indicate success or failure of the transfer. Its status will be `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` for success or `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR` if some problem was encountered. At this point further SQL commands can be issued via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec). (It is not possible to execute other SQL commands using the same connection while the `COPY` operation is in progress.)

If a `COPY` command is issued via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) in a string that could contain additional commands, the application must continue fetching results via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) after completing the `COPY` sequence. Only when [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) returns `NULL` is it certain that the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) command string is done and it is safe to issue more commands.

The functions of this section should be executed only after obtaining a result status of `PGRES_COPY_OUT` or `PGRES_COPY_IN` from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult).

A PGresult object bearing one of these status values carries some additional data about the `COPY` operation that is starting. This additional data is available using functions that are also used in connection with query results:

`PQnfields`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the number of columns (fields) to be copied.

`PQbinaryTuples`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
0 indicates the overall copy format is textual (rows separated by newlines, columns separated by separator characters, etc.). 1 indicates the overall copy format is binary. See [???](#sql-copy) for more information.

`PQfformat`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the format code (0 for text, 1 for binary) associated with each column of the copy operation. The per-column format codes will always be zero when the overall copy format is textual, but the binary format can support both text and binary columns. (However, as of the current implementation of `COPY`, only binary columns appear in a binary copy; so the per-column formats always match the overall format at present.)

### Functions for Sending `COPY` Data

These functions are used to send data during `COPY FROM STDIN`. They will fail if called when the connection is not in `COPY_IN` state.

`PQputCopyData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends data to the server during `COPY_IN` state. int PQputCopyData(PGconn \*conn, const char \*buffer, int nbytes);

Transmits the `COPY` data in the specified `buffer`, of length `nbytes`, to the server. The result is 1 if the data was queued, zero if it was not queued because of full buffers (this will only happen in nonblocking mode), or -1 if an error occurred. (Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to retrieve details if the return value is -1. If the value is zero, wait for write-ready and try again.)

The application can divide the `COPY` data stream into buffer loads of any convenient size. Buffer-load boundaries have no semantic significance when sending. The contents of the data stream must match the data format expected by the `COPY` command; see [???](#sql-copy) for details.

`PQputCopyEnd`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends end-of-data indication to the server during `COPY_IN` state. int PQputCopyEnd(PGconn \*conn, const char \*errormsg);

Ends the `COPY_IN` operation successfully if `errormsg` is `NULL`. If `errormsg` is not `NULL` then the `COPY` is forced to fail, with the string pointed to by `errormsg` used as the error message. (One should not assume that this exact error message will come back from the server, however, as the server might have already failed the `COPY` for its own reasons.)

The result is 1 if the termination message was sent; or in nonblocking mode, this may only indicate that the termination message was successfully queued. (In nonblocking mode, to be certain that the data has been sent, you should next wait for write-ready and call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQflush), repeating until it returns zero.) Zero indicates that the function could not queue the termination message because of full buffers; this will only happen in nonblocking mode. (In this case, wait for write-ready and try the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputCopyEnd) call again.) If a hard error occurs, -1 is returned; you can use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to retrieve details.

After successfully calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputCopyEnd), call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the final result status of the `COPY` command. One can wait for this result to be available in the usual way. Then return to normal operation.

### Functions for Receiving `COPY` Data

These functions are used to receive data during `COPY TO STDOUT`. They will fail if called when the connection is not in `COPY_OUT` state.

`PQgetCopyData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Receives data from the server during `COPY_OUT` state. int PQgetCopyData(PGconn \*conn, char \*\*buffer, int async);

Attempts to obtain another row of data from the server during a `COPY`. Data is always returned one data row at a time; if only a partial row is available, it is not returned. Successful return of a data row involves allocating a chunk of memory to hold the data. The `buffer` parameter must be non-`NULL`. `*buffer` is set to point to the allocated memory, or to `NULL` in cases where no buffer is returned. A non-`NULL` result buffer should be freed using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem) when no longer needed.

When a row is successfully returned, the return value is the number of data bytes in the row (this will always be greater than zero). The returned string is always null-terminated, though this is probably only useful for textual `COPY`. A result of zero indicates that the `COPY` is still in progress, but no row is yet available (this is only possible when `async` is true). A result of -1 indicates that the `COPY` is done. A result of -2 indicates that an error occurred (consult [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) for the reason).

When `async` is true (not zero), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCopyData) will not block waiting for input; it will return zero if the `COPY` is still in progress but no complete row is available. (In this case wait for read-ready and then call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) before calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCopyData) again.) When `async` is false (zero), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCopyData) will block until data is available or the operation completes.

After [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetCopyData) returns -1, call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) to obtain the final result status of the `COPY` command. One can wait for this result to be available in the usual way. Then return to normal operation.

### Obsolete Functions for `COPY`

These functions represent older methods of handling `COPY`. Although they still work, they are deprecated due to poor error handling, inconvenient methods of detecting end-of-data, and lack of support for binary or nonblocking transfers.

`PQgetline`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Reads a newline-terminated line of characters (transmitted by the server) into a buffer string of size `length`. int PQgetline(PGconn \*conn, char \*buffer, int length);

This function copies up to `length`-1 characters into the buffer and converts the terminating newline into a zero byte. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetline) returns `EOF` at the end of input, 0 if the entire line has been read, and 1 if the buffer is full but the terminating newline has not yet been read.

Note that the application must check to see if a new line consists of the two characters `\.`, which indicates that the server has finished sending the results of the `COPY` command. If the application might receive lines that are more than `length`-1 characters long, care is needed to be sure it recognizes the `\.` line correctly (and does not, for example, mistake the end of a long data line for a terminator line).

`PQgetlineAsync`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Reads a row of `COPY` data (transmitted by the server) into a buffer without blocking. int PQgetlineAsync(PGconn \*conn, char \*buffer, int bufsize);

This function is similar to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetline), but it can be used by applications that must read `COPY` data asynchronously, that is, without blocking. Having issued the `COPY` command and gotten a `PGRES_COPY_OUT` response, the application should call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconsumeInput) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetlineAsync) until the end-of-data signal is detected.

Unlike [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetline), this function takes responsibility for detecting end-of-data.

On each call, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetlineAsync) will return data if a complete data row is available in libpq's input buffer. Otherwise, no data is returned until the rest of the row arrives. The function returns -1 if the end-of-copy-data marker has been recognized, or 0 if no data is available, or a positive number giving the number of bytes of data returned. If -1 is returned, the caller must next call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy), and then return to normal processing.

The data returned will not extend beyond a data-row boundary. If possible a whole row will be returned at one time. But if the buffer offered by the caller is too small to hold a row sent by the server, then a partial data row will be returned. With textual data this can be detected by testing whether the last returned byte is `\n` or not. (In a binary `COPY`, actual parsing of the `COPY` data format will be needed to make the equivalent determination.) The returned string is not null-terminated. (If you want to add a terminating null, be sure to pass a `bufsize` one smaller than the room actually available.)

`PQputline`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a null-terminated string to the server. Returns 0 if OK and `EOF` if unable to send the string. int PQputline(PGconn \*conn, const char \*string);

The `COPY` data stream sent by a series of calls to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline) has the same format as that returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetlineAsync), except that applications are not obliged to send exactly one data row per [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline) call; it is okay to send a partial line or multiple lines per call.

> [!NOTE]
> Before PostgreSQL protocol 3.0, it was necessary for the application to explicitly send the two characters `\.` as a final line to indicate to the server that it had finished sending `COPY` data. While this still works, it is deprecated and the special meaning of `\.` can be expected to be removed in a future release. It is sufficient to call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy) after having sent the actual data.

`PQputnbytes`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sends a non-null-terminated string to the server. Returns 0 if OK and `EOF` if unable to send the string. int PQputnbytes(PGconn \*conn, const char \*buffer, int nbytes);

This is exactly like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline), except that the data buffer need not be null-terminated since the number of bytes to send is specified directly. Use this procedure when sending binary data.

`PQendcopy`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Synchronizes with the server. int PQendcopy(PGconn \*conn); This function waits until the server has finished the copying. It should either be issued when the last string has been sent to the server using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline) or when the last string has been received from the server using `PQgetline`. It must be issued or the server will get “out of sync” with the client. Upon return from this function, the server is ready to receive the next SQL command. The return value is 0 on successful completion, nonzero otherwise. (Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to retrieve details if the return value is nonzero.)

When using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult), the application should respond to a `PGRES_COPY_OUT` result by executing [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetline) repeatedly, followed by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy) after the terminator line is seen. It should then return to the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) loop until [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) returns a null pointer. Similarly a `PGRES_COPY_IN` result is processed by a series of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQputline) calls followed by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy), then return to the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult) loop. This arrangement will ensure that a `COPY` command embedded in a series of SQL commands will be executed correctly.

Older applications are likely to submit a `COPY` via [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQexec) and assume that the transaction is done after [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQendcopy). This will work correctly only if the `COPY` is the only SQL command in the command string.

## Control Functions

These functions control miscellaneous details of libpq's behavior.

`PQclientEncoding`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the client encoding. int PQclientEncoding(const PGconn \*\<conn\>); Note that it returns the encoding ID, not a symbolic string such as `EUC_JP`. If unsuccessful, it returns -1. To convert an encoding ID to an encoding name, you can use: char \*pg_encoding_to_char(int \<encoding_id\>);

`PQsetClientEncoding`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets the client encoding. int PQsetClientEncoding(PGconn \*\<conn\>, const char \*\<encoding\>); \<conn\> is a connection to the server, and \<encoding\> is the encoding you want to use. If the function successfully sets the encoding, it returns 0, otherwise -1. The current encoding for this connection can be determined by using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclientEncoding).

`PQsetErrorVerbosity`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Determines the verbosity of messages returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage). typedef enum { PQERRORS_TERSE, PQERRORS_DEFAULT, PQERRORS_VERBOSE, PQERRORS_SQLSTATE } PGVerbosity; PGVerbosity PQsetErrorVerbosity(PGconn \*conn, PGVerbosity verbosity); [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetErrorVerbosity) sets the verbosity mode, returning the connection's previous setting. In TERSE mode, returned messages include severity, primary text, and position only; this will normally fit on a single line. The DEFAULT mode produces messages that include the above plus any detail, hint, or context fields (these might span multiple lines). The VERBOSE mode includes all available fields. The SQLSTATE mode includes only the error severity and the `SQLSTATE` error code, if one is available (if not, the output is like TERSE mode).

Changing the verbosity setting does not affect the messages available from already-existing PGresult objects, only subsequently-created ones. (But see [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultVerboseErrorMessage) if you want to print a previous error with a different verbosity.)

`PQsetErrorContextVisibility`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Determines the handling of `CONTEXT` fields in messages returned by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage). typedef enum { PQSHOW_CONTEXT_NEVER, PQSHOW_CONTEXT_ERRORS, PQSHOW_CONTEXT_ALWAYS } PGContextVisibility; PGContextVisibility PQsetErrorContextVisibility(PGconn \*conn, PGContextVisibility show_context); [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetErrorContextVisibility) sets the context display mode, returning the connection's previous setting. This mode controls whether the `CONTEXT` field is included in messages. The NEVER mode never includes `CONTEXT`, while ALWAYS always includes it if available. In ERRORS mode (the default), `CONTEXT` fields are included only in error messages, not in notices and warnings. (However, if the verbosity setting is TERSE or SQLSTATE, `CONTEXT` fields are omitted regardless of the context display mode.)

Changing this mode does not affect the messages available from already-existing PGresult objects, only subsequently-created ones. (But see [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultVerboseErrorMessage) if you want to print a previous error with a different display mode.)

`PQtrace`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Enables tracing of the client/server communication to a debugging file stream. void PQtrace(PGconn \*conn, FILE \*stream);

Each line consists of: an optional timestamp, a direction indicator (`F` for messages from client to server or `B` for messages from server to client), message length, message type, and message contents. Non-message contents fields (timestamp, direction, length and message type) are separated by a tab. Message contents are separated by a space. Protocol strings are enclosed in double quotes, while strings used as data values are enclosed in single quotes. Non-printable chars are printed as hexadecimal escapes. Further message-type-specific detail can be found in [???](#protocol-message-formats).

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, if the libpq library and an application are compiled with different flags, this function call will crash the application because the internal representation of the `FILE` pointers differ. Specifically, multithreaded/single-threaded, release/debug, and static/dynamic flags should be the same for the library and all applications using that library.

`PQsetTraceFlags`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Controls the tracing behavior of client/server communication. void PQsetTraceFlags(PGconn \*conn, int flags);

`flags` contains flag bits describing the operating mode of tracing. If `flags` contains `PQTRACE_SUPPRESS_TIMESTAMPS`, then the timestamp is not included when printing each message. If `flags` contains `PQTRACE_REGRESS_MODE`, then some fields are redacted when printing each message, such as object OIDs, to make the output more convenient to use in testing frameworks. This function must be called after calling `PQtrace`.

`PQuntrace`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Disables tracing started by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQtrace). void PQuntrace(PGconn \*conn);

## Miscellaneous Functions

As always, there are some functions that just don't fit anywhere.

`PQfreemem`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Frees memory allocated by libpq. void PQfreemem(void \*ptr);

Frees memory allocated by libpq, particularly [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeByteaConn), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQescapeBytea), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQunescapeBytea), and `PQnotifies`. It is particularly important that this function, rather than `free()`, be used on Microsoft Windows. This is because allocating memory in a DLL and releasing it in the application works only if multithreaded/single-threaded, release/debug, and static/dynamic flags are the same for the DLL and the application. On non-Microsoft Windows platforms, this function is the same as the standard library function `free()`.

`PQconninfoFree`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Frees the data structures allocated by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconndefaults) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconninfoParse). void PQconninfoFree(PQconninfoOption \*connOptions); If the argument is a `NULL` pointer, no operation is performed.

A simple [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem) will not do for this, since the array contains references to subsidiary strings.

`PQencryptPasswordConn`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Prepares the encrypted form of a PostgreSQL password. char \*PQencryptPasswordConn(PGconn \*conn, const char \*passwd, const char \*user, const char \*algorithm); This function is intended to be used by client applications that wish to send commands like `ALTER USER joe PASSWORD 'pwd'`. It is good practice not to send the original cleartext password in such a command, because it might be exposed in command logs, activity displays, and so on. Instead, use this function to convert the password to encrypted form before it is sent.

The `passwd` and `user` arguments are the cleartext password, and the SQL name of the user it is for. `algorithm` specifies the encryption algorithm to use to encrypt the password. Currently supported algorithms are `md5` and `scram-sha-256` (`on` and `off` are also accepted as aliases for `md5`, for compatibility with older server versions). Note that support for `scram-sha-256` was introduced in PostgreSQL version 10, and will not work correctly with older server versions. If `algorithm` is `NULL`, this function will query the server for the current value of the [???](#guc-password-encryption) setting. That can block, and will fail if the current transaction is aborted, or if the connection is busy executing another query. If you wish to use the default algorithm for the server but want to avoid blocking, query `password_encryption` yourself before calling [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQencryptPasswordConn), and pass that value as the `algorithm`.

The return value is a string allocated by `malloc`. The caller can assume the string doesn't contain any special characters that would require escaping. Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfreemem) to free the result when done with it. On error, returns `NULL`, and a suitable message is stored in the connection object.

`PQchangePassword`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Changes a PostgreSQL password. PGresult \*PQchangePassword(PGconn \*conn, const char \*user, const char \*passwd); This function uses `PQencryptPasswordConn` to build and execute the command `ALTER USER ... PASSWORD '...'`, thereby changing the user's password. It exists for the same reason as `PQencryptPasswordConn`, but is more convenient as it both builds and runs the command for you. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQencryptPasswordConn) is passed a `NULL` for the algorithm argument, hence encryption is done according to the server's [???](#guc-password-encryption) setting.

The `user` and `passwd` arguments are the SQL name of the target user, and the new cleartext password.

Returns a PGresult pointer representing the result of the `ALTER USER` command, or a null pointer if the routine failed before issuing any command. The [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultStatus) function should be called to check the return value for any errors (including the value of a null pointer, in which case it will return `PGRES_FATAL_ERROR`). Use [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQerrorMessage) to get more information about such errors.

`PQencryptPassword`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Prepares the md5-encrypted form of a PostgreSQL password. char \*PQencryptPassword(const char \*passwd, const char \*user); [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQencryptPassword) is an older, deprecated version of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQencryptPasswordConn). The difference is that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQencryptPassword) does not require a connection object, and `md5` is always used as the encryption algorithm.

`PQmakeEmptyPGresult`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Constructs an empty PGresult object with the given status. PGresult \*PQmakeEmptyPGresult(PGconn \*conn, ExecStatusType status);

This is libpq's internal function to allocate and initialize an empty PGresult object. This function returns `NULL` if memory could not be allocated. It is exported because some applications find it useful to generate result objects (particularly objects with error status) themselves. If `conn` is not null and `status` indicates an error, the current error message of the specified connection is copied into the PGresult. Also, if `conn` is not null, any event procedures registered in the connection are copied into the PGresult. (They do not get `PGEVT_RESULTCREATE` calls, but see [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfireResultCreateEvents).) Note that [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) should eventually be called on the object, just as with a PGresult returned by libpq itself.

`PQfireResultCreateEvents`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Fires a `PGEVT_RESULTCREATE` event (see [Event System](#libpq-events)) for each event procedure registered in the PGresult object. Returns non-zero for success, zero if any event procedure fails. int PQfireResultCreateEvents(PGconn \*conn, PGresult \*res);

The `conn` argument is passed through to event procedures but not used directly. It can be `NULL` if the event procedures won't use it.

Event procedures that have already received a `PGEVT_RESULTCREATE` or `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` event for this object are not fired again.

The main reason that this function is separate from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQmakeEmptyPGresult) is that it is often appropriate to create a PGresult and fill it with data before invoking the event procedures.

`PQcopyResult`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Makes a copy of a PGresult object. The copy is not linked to the source result in any way and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) must be called when the copy is no longer needed. If the function fails, `NULL` is returned. PGresult \*PQcopyResult(const PGresult \*src, int flags);

This is not intended to make an exact copy. The returned result is always put into `PGRES_TUPLES_OK` status, and does not copy any error message in the source. (It does copy the command status string, however.) The `flags` argument determines what else is copied. It is a bitwise OR of several flags. `PG_COPYRES_ATTRS` specifies copying the source result's attributes (column definitions). `PG_COPYRES_TUPLES` specifies copying the source result's tuples. (This implies copying the attributes, too.) `PG_COPYRES_NOTICEHOOKS` specifies copying the source result's notify hooks. `PG_COPYRES_EVENTS` specifies copying the source result's events. (But any instance data associated with the source is not copied.) The event procedures receive `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` events.

`PQsetResultAttrs`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets the attributes of a PGresult object. int PQsetResultAttrs(PGresult \*res, int numAttributes, PGresAttDesc \*attDescs);

The provided `attDescs` are copied into the result. If the `attDescs` pointer is `NULL` or `numAttributes` is less than one, the request is ignored and the function succeeds. If `res` already contains attributes, the function will fail. If the function fails, the return value is zero. If the function succeeds, the return value is non-zero.

`PQsetvalue`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets a tuple field value of a PGresult object. int PQsetvalue(PGresult \*res, int tup_num, int field_num, char \*value, int len);

The function will automatically grow the result's internal tuples array as needed. However, the `tup_num` argument must be less than or equal to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQntuples), meaning this function can only grow the tuples array one tuple at a time. But any field of any existing tuple can be modified in any order. If a value at `field_num` already exists, it will be overwritten. If `len` is -1 or `value` is `NULL`, the field value will be set to an SQL null value. The `value` is copied into the result's private storage, thus is no longer needed after the function returns. If the function fails, the return value is zero. If the function succeeds, the return value is non-zero.

`PQresultAlloc`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Allocate subsidiary storage for a PGresult object. void \*PQresultAlloc(PGresult \*res, size_t nBytes);

Any memory allocated with this function will be freed when `res` is cleared. If the function fails, the return value is `NULL`. The result is guaranteed to be adequately aligned for any type of data, just as for `malloc`.

`PQresultMemorySize`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Retrieves the number of bytes allocated for a PGresult object. size_t PQresultMemorySize(const PGresult \*res);

This value is the sum of all `malloc` requests associated with the PGresult object, that is, all the memory that will be freed by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). This information can be useful for managing memory consumption.

`PQlibVersion`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Return the version of libpq that is being used. int PQlibVersion(void);

The result of this function can be used to determine, at run time, whether specific functionality is available in the currently loaded version of libpq. The function can be used, for example, to determine which connection options are available in [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb).

The result is formed by multiplying the library's major version number by 10000 and adding the minor version number. For example, version 10.1 will be returned as 100001, and version 11.0 will be returned as 110000.

Prior to major version 10, PostgreSQL used three-part version numbers in which the first two parts together represented the major version. For those versions, [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQlibVersion) uses two digits for each part; for example version 9.1.5 will be returned as 90105, and version 9.2.0 will be returned as 90200.

Therefore, for purposes of determining feature compatibility, applications should divide the result of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQlibVersion) by 100 not 10000 to determine a logical major version number. In all release series, only the last two digits differ between minor releases (bug-fix releases).

> [!NOTE]
> This function appeared in PostgreSQL version 9.1, so it cannot be used to detect required functionality in earlier versions, since calling it will create a link dependency on version 9.1 or later.

`PQgetCurrentTimeUSec`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of microseconds since the Unix epoch (that is, `time_t` times 1 million). pg_usec_time_t PQgetCurrentTimeUSec(void);

This is primarily useful for calculating timeout values to use with [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsocketPoll).

## Notice Processing

notice processing

in libpq

Notice and warning messages generated by the server are not returned by the query execution functions, since they do not imply failure of the query. Instead they are passed to a notice handling function, and execution continues normally after the handler returns. The default notice handling function prints the message on `stderr`, but the application can override this behavior by supplying its own handling function.

For historical reasons, there are two levels of notice handling, called the notice receiver and notice processor. The default behavior is for the notice receiver to format the notice and pass a string to the notice processor for printing. However, an application that chooses to provide its own notice receiver will typically ignore the notice processor layer and just do all the work in the notice receiver.

The function `PQsetNoticeReceiver` <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span> sets or examines the current notice receiver for a connection object. Similarly, `PQsetNoticeProcessor` <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span> sets or examines the current notice processor. typedef void (\*PQnoticeReceiver) (void \*arg, const PGresult \*res); PQnoticeReceiver PQsetNoticeReceiver(PGconn \*conn, PQnoticeReceiver proc, void \*arg); typedef void (\*PQnoticeProcessor) (void \*arg, const char \*message); PQnoticeProcessor PQsetNoticeProcessor(PGconn \*conn, PQnoticeProcessor proc, void \*arg); Each of these functions returns the previous notice receiver or processor function pointer, and sets the new value. If you supply a null function pointer, no action is taken, but the current pointer is returned.

When a notice or warning message is received from the server, or generated internally by libpq, the notice receiver function is called. It is passed the message in the form of a `PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR` PGresult. (This allows the receiver to extract individual fields using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorField), or obtain a complete preformatted message using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage) or [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultVerboseErrorMessage).) The same void pointer passed to `PQsetNoticeReceiver` is also passed. (This pointer can be used to access application-specific state if needed.)

The default notice receiver simply extracts the message (using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultErrorMessage)) and passes it to the notice processor.

The notice processor is responsible for handling a notice or warning message given in text form. It is passed the string text of the message (including a trailing newline), plus a void pointer that is the same one passed to `PQsetNoticeProcessor`. (This pointer can be used to access application-specific state if needed.)

The default notice processor is simply:

    static void
    defaultNoticeProcessor(void *arg, const char *message)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s", message);
    }

Once you have set a notice receiver or processor, you should expect that that function could be called as long as either the PGconn object or PGresult objects made from it exist. At creation of a PGresult, the PGconn's current notice handling pointers are copied into the PGresult for possible use by functions like [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetvalue).

## Event System

libpq's event system is designed to notify registered event handlers about interesting libpq events, such as the creation or destruction of PGconn and PGresult objects. A principal use case is that this allows applications to associate their own data with a PGconn or PGresult and ensure that that data is freed at an appropriate time.

Each registered event handler is associated with two pieces of data, known to libpq only as opaque `void *` pointers. There is a pass-through pointer that is provided by the application when the event handler is registered with a PGconn. The pass-through pointer never changes for the life of the PGconn and all PGresults generated from it; so if used, it must point to long-lived data. In addition there is an instance data pointer, which starts out `NULL` in every PGconn and PGresult. This pointer can be manipulated using the [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinstanceData), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetInstanceData), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultInstanceData) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultSetInstanceData) functions. Note that unlike the pass-through pointer, instance data of a PGconn is not automatically inherited by PGresults created from it. libpq does not know what pass-through and instance data pointers point to (if anything) and will never attempt to free them that is the responsibility of the event handler.

### Event Types

The enum `PGEventId` names the types of events handled by the event system. All its values have names beginning with `PGEVT`. For each event type, there is a corresponding event info structure that carries the parameters passed to the event handlers. The event types are:

`PGEVT_REGISTER`  
The register event occurs when [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQregisterEventProc) is called. It is the ideal time to initialize any `instanceData` an event procedure may need. Only one register event will be fired per event handler per connection. If the event procedure fails (returns zero), the registration is canceled. typedef struct { PGconn \*conn; } PGEventRegister; When a `PGEVT_REGISTER` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventRegister \*. This structure contains a PGconn that should be in the `CONNECTION_OK` status; guaranteed if one calls [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQregisterEventProc) right after obtaining a good PGconn. When returning a failure code, all cleanup must be performed as no `PGEVT_CONNDESTROY` event will be sent.

`PGEVT_CONNRESET`  
The connection reset event is fired on completion of [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQreset) or `PQresetPoll`. In both cases, the event is only fired if the reset was successful. The return value of the event procedure is ignored in PostgreSQL v15 and later. With earlier versions, however, it's important to return success (nonzero) or the connection will be aborted. typedef struct { PGconn \*conn; } PGEventConnReset; When a `PGEVT_CONNRESET` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventConnReset \*. Although the contained PGconn was just reset, all event data remains unchanged. This event should be used to reset/reload/requery any associated `instanceData`. Note that even if the event procedure fails to process `PGEVT_CONNRESET`, it will still receive a `PGEVT_CONNDESTROY` event when the connection is closed.

`PGEVT_CONNDESTROY`  
The connection destroy event is fired in response to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish). It is the event procedure's responsibility to properly clean up its event data as libpq has no ability to manage this memory. Failure to clean up will lead to memory leaks. typedef struct { PGconn \*conn; } PGEventConnDestroy; When a `PGEVT_CONNDESTROY` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventConnDestroy \*. This event is fired prior to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish) performing any other cleanup. The return value of the event procedure is ignored since there is no way of indicating a failure from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQfinish). Also, an event procedure failure should not abort the process of cleaning up unwanted memory.

`PGEVT_RESULTCREATE`  
The result creation event is fired in response to any query execution function that generates a result, including [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQgetResult). This event will only be fired after the result has been created successfully. typedef struct { PGconn \*conn; PGresult \*result; } PGEventResultCreate; When a `PGEVT_RESULTCREATE` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventResultCreate \*. The `conn` is the connection used to generate the result. This is the ideal place to initialize any `instanceData` that needs to be associated with the result. If an event procedure fails (returns zero), that event procedure will be ignored for the remaining lifetime of the result; that is, it will not receive `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` or `PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY` events for this result or results copied from it.

`PGEVT_RESULTCOPY`  
The result copy event is fired in response to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcopyResult). This event will only be fired after the copy is complete. Only event procedures that have successfully handled the `PGEVT_RESULTCREATE` or `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` event for the source result will receive `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` events. typedef struct { const PGresult \*src; PGresult \*dest; } PGEventResultCopy; When a `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventResultCopy \*. The `src` result is what was copied while the `dest` result is the copy destination. This event can be used to provide a deep copy of `instanceData`, since `PQcopyResult` cannot do that. If an event procedure fails (returns zero), that event procedure will be ignored for the remaining lifetime of the new result; that is, it will not receive `PGEVT_RESULTCOPY` or `PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY` events for that result or results copied from it.

`PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY`  
The result destroy event is fired in response to a [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). It is the event procedure's responsibility to properly clean up its event data as libpq has no ability to manage this memory. Failure to clean up will lead to memory leaks. typedef struct { PGresult \*result; } PGEventResultDestroy; When a `PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY` event is received, the `evtInfo` pointer should be cast to a PGEventResultDestroy \*. This event is fired prior to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear) performing any other cleanup. The return value of the event procedure is ignored since there is no way of indicating a failure from [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQclear). Also, an event procedure failure should not abort the process of cleaning up unwanted memory.

### Event Callback Procedure

`PGEventProc`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
`PGEventProc` is a typedef for a pointer to an event procedure, that is, the user callback function that receives events from libpq. The signature of an event procedure must be int eventproc(PGEventId evtId, void \*evtInfo, void \*passThrough) The `evtId` parameter indicates which `PGEVT` event occurred. The `evtInfo` pointer must be cast to the appropriate structure type to obtain further information about the event. The `passThrough` parameter is the pointer provided to [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQregisterEventProc) when the event procedure was registered. The function should return a non-zero value if it succeeds and zero if it fails.

A particular event procedure can be registered only once in any PGconn. This is because the address of the procedure is used as a lookup key to identify the associated instance data.

> [!CAUTION]
> On Windows, functions can have two different addresses: one visible from outside a DLL and another visible from inside the DLL. One should be careful that only one of these addresses is used with libpq's event-procedure functions, else confusion will result. The simplest rule for writing code that will work is to ensure that event procedures are declared `static`. If the procedure's address must be available outside its own source file, expose a separate function to return the address.

### Event Support Functions

`PQregisterEventProc`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Registers an event callback procedure with libpq. int PQregisterEventProc(PGconn \*conn, PGEventProc proc, const char \*name, void \*passThrough);

An event procedure must be registered once on each PGconn you want to receive events about. There is no limit, other than memory, on the number of event procedures that can be registered with a connection. The function returns a non-zero value if it succeeds and zero if it fails.

The `proc` argument will be called when a libpq event is fired. Its memory address is also used to lookup `instanceData`. The `name` argument is used to refer to the event procedure in error messages. This value cannot be `NULL` or a zero-length string. The name string is copied into the PGconn, so what is passed need not be long-lived. The `passThrough` pointer is passed to the `proc` whenever an event occurs. This argument can be `NULL`.

`PQsetInstanceData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets the connection `conn`'s `instanceData` for procedure `proc` to `data`. This returns non-zero for success and zero for failure. (Failure is only possible if `proc` has not been properly registered in `conn`.) int PQsetInstanceData(PGconn \*conn, PGEventProc proc, void \*data);

`PQinstanceData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the connection `conn`'s `instanceData` associated with procedure `proc`, or `NULL` if there is none. void \*PQinstanceData(const PGconn \*conn, PGEventProc proc);

`PQresultSetInstanceData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Sets the result's `instanceData` for `proc` to `data`. This returns non-zero for success and zero for failure. (Failure is only possible if `proc` has not been properly registered in the result.) int PQresultSetInstanceData(PGresult \*res, PGEventProc proc, void \*data);

Beware that any storage represented by `data` will not be accounted for by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultMemorySize), unless it is allocated using [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQresultAlloc). (Doing so is recommendable because it eliminates the need to free such storage explicitly when the result is destroyed.)

`PQresultInstanceData`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the result's `instanceData` associated with `proc`, or `NULL` if there is none. void \*PQresultInstanceData(const PGresult \*res, PGEventProc proc);

### Event Example

Here is a skeleton example of managing private data associated with libpq connections and results.

    /* required header for libpq events (note: includes libpq-fe.h) */
    #include <libpq-events.h>

    /* The instanceData */
    typedef struct
    {
        int n;
        char *str;
    } mydata;

    /* PGEventProc */
    static int myEventProc(PGEventId evtId, void *evtInfo, void *passThrough);

    int
    main(void)
    {
        mydata *data;
        PGresult *res;
        PGconn *conn =
            PQconnectdb("dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=");

        if (PQstatus(conn) != CONNECTION_OK)
        {
            /* PQerrorMessage's result includes a trailing newline */
            fprintf(stderr, "%s", PQerrorMessage(conn));
            PQfinish(conn);
            return 1;
        }

        /* called once on any connection that should receive events.
         * Sends a PGEVT_REGISTER to myEventProc.
         */
        if (!PQregisterEventProc(conn, myEventProc, "mydata_proc", NULL))
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Cannot register PGEventProc\n");
            PQfinish(conn);
            return 1;
        }

        /* conn instanceData is available */
        data = PQinstanceData(conn, myEventProc);

        /* Sends a PGEVT_RESULTCREATE to myEventProc */
        res = PQexec(conn, "SELECT 1 + 1");

        /* result instanceData is available */
        data = PQresultInstanceData(res, myEventProc);

        /* If PG_COPYRES_EVENTS is used, sends a PGEVT_RESULTCOPY to myEventProc */
        res_copy = PQcopyResult(res, PG_COPYRES_TUPLES | PG_COPYRES_EVENTS);

        /* result instanceData is available if PG_COPYRES_EVENTS was
         * used during the PQcopyResult call.
         */
        data = PQresultInstanceData(res_copy, myEventProc);

        /* Both clears send a PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY to myEventProc */
        PQclear(res);
        PQclear(res_copy);

        /* Sends a PGEVT_CONNDESTROY to myEventProc */
        PQfinish(conn);

        return 0;
    }

    static int
    myEventProc(PGEventId evtId, void *evtInfo, void *passThrough)
    {
        switch (evtId)
        {

                mydata *res_data = dup_mydata(conn_data);

                /* associate app specific data with result (copy it from conn) */
                PQresultSetInstanceData(e->result, myEventProc, res_data);

                mydata *dest_data = dup_mydata(src_data);

## Environment Variables

environment variable

The following environment variables can be used to select default connection parameter values, which will be used by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQconnectdb), [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetdbLogin) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQsetdb) if no value is directly specified by the calling code. These are useful to avoid hard-coding database connection information into simple client applications, for example.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGHOST` behaves the same as the [host](#libpq-connect-host) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGSSLNEGOTIATION` behaves the same as the [sslnegotiation](#libpq-connect-sslnegotiation) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGHOSTADDR` behaves the same as the [hostaddr](#libpq-connect-hostaddr) connection parameter. This can be set instead of or in addition to `PGHOST` to avoid DNS lookup overhead.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGPORT` behaves the same as the [port](#libpq-connect-port) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGDATABASE` behaves the same as the [dbname](#libpq-connect-dbname) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGUSER` behaves the same as the [user](#libpq-connect-user) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGPASSWORD` behaves the same as the [password](#libpq-connect-password) connection parameter. Use of this environment variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using a password file (see [The Password File](#libpq-pgpass)).

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGPASSFILE` behaves the same as the [passfile](#libpq-connect-passfile) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGREQUIREAUTH` behaves the same as the [require_auth](#libpq-connect-require-auth) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGSERVICEFILE` specifies the name of the per-user connection service file (see [The Connection Service File](#libpq-pgservice)). Defaults to `~/.pg_service.conf`, or `%APPDATA%\postgresql\.pg_service.conf` on Microsoft Windows.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGOPTIONS` behaves the same as the [options](#libpq-connect-options) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGAPPNAME` behaves the same as the [application_name](#libpq-connect-application-name) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGSSLMODE` behaves the same as the [sslmode](#libpq-connect-sslmode) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGREQUIRESSL` behaves the same as the [requiressl](#libpq-connect-requiressl) connection parameter. This environment variable is deprecated in favor of the `PGSSLMODE` variable; setting both variables suppresses the effect of this one.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGKRBSRVNAME` behaves the same as the [krbsrvname](#libpq-connect-krbsrvname) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGGSSLIB` behaves the same as the [gsslib](#libpq-connect-gsslib) connection parameter.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGLOADBALANCEHOSTS` behaves the same as the [load_balance_hosts](#libpq-connect-load-balance-hosts) connection parameter.

The following environment variables can be used to specify default behavior for each PostgreSQL session. (See also the [???](#sql-alterrole) and [???](#sql-alterdatabase) commands for ways to set default behavior on a per-user or per-database basis.)

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGDATESTYLE` sets the default style of date/time representation. (Equivalent to `SET datestyle TO ...`.)

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGTZ` sets the default time zone. (Equivalent to `SET timezone TO ...`.)

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGGEQO` sets the default mode for the genetic query optimizer. (Equivalent to `SET geqo TO ...`.)

Refer to the SQL command [???](#sql-set) for information on correct values for these environment variables.

The following environment variables determine internal behavior of libpq; they override compiled-in defaults.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGSYSCONFDIR` sets the directory containing the `pg_service.conf` file and in a future version possibly other system-wide configuration files.

- <span class="indexterm"></span> `PGLOCALEDIR` sets the directory containing the `locale` files for message localization.

## The Password File

password file

.pgpass

The file `.pgpass` in a user's home directory can contain passwords to be used if the connection requires a password (and no password has been specified otherwise). On Microsoft Windows the file is named `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf` (where `%APPDATA%` refers to the Application Data subdirectory in the user's profile). Alternatively, the password file to use can be specified using the connection parameter [passfile](#libpq-connect-passfile) or the environment variable `PGPASSFILE`.

This file should contain lines of the following format: \<hostname\>:\<port\>:\<database\>:\<username\>:\<password\> (You can add a reminder comment to the file by copying the line above and preceding it with `#`.) Each of the first four fields can be a literal value, or `*`, which matches anything. The password field from the first line that matches the current connection parameters will be used. (Therefore, put more-specific entries first when you are using wildcards.) If an entry needs to contain `:` or `\`, escape this character with `\`. The host name field is matched to the `host` connection parameter if that is specified, otherwise to the `hostaddr` parameter if that is specified; if neither are given then the host name `localhost` is searched for. The host name `localhost` is also searched for when the connection is a Unix-domain socket connection and the `host` parameter matches libpq's default socket directory path. In a standby server, a database field of `replication` matches streaming replication connections made to the primary server. The database field is of limited usefulness otherwise, because users have the same password for all databases in the same cluster.

On Unix systems, the permissions on a password file must disallow any access to world or group; achieve this by a command such as `chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass`. If the permissions are less strict than this, the file will be ignored. On Microsoft Windows, it is assumed that the file is stored in a directory that is secure, so no special permissions check is made.

## The Connection Service File

connection service file

pg_service.conf

.pg_service.conf

The connection service file allows libpq connection parameters to be associated with a single service name. That service name can then be specified in a libpq connection string, and the associated settings will be used. This allows connection parameters to be modified without requiring a recompile of the libpq-using application. The service name can also be specified using the `PGSERVICE` environment variable.

Service names can be defined in either a per-user service file or a system-wide file. If the same service name exists in both the user and the system file, the user file takes precedence. By default, the per-user service file is named `~/.pg_service.conf`. On Microsoft Windows, it is named `%APPDATA%\postgresql\.pg_service.conf` (where `%APPDATA%` refers to the Application Data subdirectory in the user's profile). A different file name can be specified by setting the environment variable `PGSERVICEFILE`. The system-wide file is named `pg_service.conf`. By default it is sought in the `etc` directory of the PostgreSQL installation (use `pg_config --sysconfdir` to identify this directory precisely). Another directory, but not a different file name, can be specified by setting the environment variable `PGSYSCONFDIR`.

Either service file uses an “INI file” format where the section name is the service name and the parameters are connection parameters; see [Parameter Key Words](#libpq-paramkeywords) for a list. For example:

    # comment
    [mydb]
    host=somehost
    port=5433
    user=admin

An example file is provided in the PostgreSQL installation at `share/pg_service.conf.sample`.

Connection parameters obtained from a service file are combined with parameters obtained from other sources. A service file setting overrides the corresponding environment variable, and in turn can be overridden by a value given directly in the connection string. For example, using the above service file, a connection string `service=mydb port=5434` will use host `somehost`, port `5434`, user `admin`, and other parameters as set by environment variables or built-in defaults.

## LDAP Lookup of Connection Parameters

LDAP connection parameter lookup

If libpq has been compiled with LDAP support (option `--with-ldap` for `configure`) it is possible to retrieve connection options like `host` or `dbname` via LDAP from a central server. The advantage is that if the connection parameters for a database change, the connection information doesn't have to be updated on all client machines.

LDAP connection parameter lookup uses the connection service file `pg_service.conf` (see [The Connection Service File](#libpq-pgservice)). A line in a `pg_service.conf` stanza that starts with `ldap://` will be recognized as an LDAP URL and an LDAP query will be performed. The result must be a list of `keyword = value` pairs which will be used to set connection options. The URL must conform to [RFC 1959](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1959) and be of the form ldap://\[\<hostname\>\[:\<port\>\]\]/\<search_base\>?\<attribute\>?\<search_scope\>?\<filter\> where \<hostname\> defaults to `localhost` and \<port\> defaults to 389.

Processing of `pg_service.conf` is terminated after a successful LDAP lookup, but is continued if the LDAP server cannot be contacted. This is to provide a fallback with further LDAP URL lines that point to different LDAP servers, classical `keyword = value` pairs, or default connection options. If you would rather get an error message in this case, add a syntactically incorrect line after the LDAP URL.

A sample LDAP entry that has been created with the LDIF file

    version:1
    dn:cn=mydatabase,dc=mycompany,dc=com
    changetype:add
    objectclass:top
    objectclass:device
    cn:mydatabase
    description:host=dbserver.mycompany.com
    description:port=5439
    description:dbname=mydb
    description:user=mydb_user
    description:sslmode=require

might be queried with the following LDAP URL:

    ldap://ldap.mycompany.com/dc=mycompany,dc=com?description?one?(cn=mydatabase)

You can also mix regular service file entries with LDAP lookups. A complete example for a stanza in `pg_service.conf` would be:

    # only host and port are stored in LDAP, specify dbname and user explicitly
    [customerdb]
    dbname=customer
    user=appuser
    ldap://ldap.acme.com/cn=dbserver,cn=hosts?pgconnectinfo?base?(objectclass=*)

## SSL Support

SSL

TLS

PostgreSQL has native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications using TLS protocols for increased security. See [???](#ssl-tcp) for details about the server-side SSL functionality.

libpq reads the system-wide OpenSSL configuration file. By default, this file is named `openssl.cnf` and is located in the directory reported by `openssl version -d`. This default can be overridden by setting environment variable `OPENSSL_CONF` to the name of the desired configuration file.

### Client Verification of Server Certificates

By default, PostgreSQL will not perform any verification of the server certificate. This means that it is possible to spoof the server identity (for example by modifying a DNS record or by taking over the server IP address) without the client knowing. In order to prevent spoofing, the client must be able to verify the server's identity via a chain of trust. A chain of trust is established by placing a root (self-signed) certificate authority (CA) certificate on one computer and a leaf certificate *signed* by the root certificate on another computer. It is also possible to use an “intermediate” certificate which is signed by the root certificate and signs leaf certificates.

To allow the client to verify the identity of the server, place a root certificate on the client and a leaf certificate signed by the root certificate on the server. To allow the server to verify the identity of the client, place a root certificate on the server and a leaf certificate signed by the root certificate on the client. One or more intermediate certificates (usually stored with the leaf certificate) can also be used to link the leaf certificate to the root certificate.

Once a chain of trust has been established, there are two ways for the client to validate the leaf certificate sent by the server. If the parameter `sslmode` is set to `verify-ca`, libpq will verify that the server is trustworthy by checking the certificate chain up to the root certificate stored on the client. If `sslmode` is set to `verify-full`, libpq will *also* verify that the server host name matches the name stored in the server certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the server certificate cannot be verified. `verify-full` is recommended in most security-sensitive environments.

In `verify-full` mode, the host name is matched against the certificate's Subject Alternative Name attribute(s) (SAN), or against the Common Name attribute if no SAN of type `dNSName` is present. If the certificate's name attribute starts with an asterisk (`*`), the asterisk will be treated as a wildcard, which will match all characters *except* a dot (`.`). This means the certificate will not match subdomains. If the connection is made using an IP address instead of a host name, the IP address will be matched (without doing any DNS lookups) against SANs of type `iPAddress` or `dNSName`. If no `iPAddress` SAN is present and no matching `dNSName` SAN is present, the host IP address is matched against the Common Name attribute.

> [!NOTE]
> For backward compatibility with earlier versions of PostgreSQL, the host IP address is verified in a manner different from [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125). The host IP address is always matched against `dNSName` SANs as well as `iPAddress` SANs, and can be matched against the Common Name attribute if no relevant SANs exist.

To allow server certificate verification, one or more root certificates must be placed in the file `~/.postgresql/root.crt` in the user's home directory. (On Microsoft Windows the file is named `%APPDATA%\postgresql\root.crt`.) Intermediate certificates should also be added to the file if they are needed to link the certificate chain sent by the server to the root certificates stored on the client.

Certificate Revocation List (CRL) entries are also checked if the file `~/.postgresql/root.crl` exists (`%APPDATA%\postgresql\root.crl` on Microsoft Windows).

The location of the root certificate file and the CRL can be changed by setting the connection parameters `sslrootcert` and `sslcrl` or the environment variables `PGSSLROOTCERT` and `PGSSLCRL`. `sslcrldir` or the environment variable `PGSSLCRLDIR` can also be used to specify a directory containing CRL files.

> [!NOTE]
> For backwards compatibility with earlier versions of PostgreSQL, if a root CA file exists, the behavior of `sslmode`=`require` will be the same as that of `verify-ca`, meaning the server certificate is validated against the CA. Relying on this behavior is discouraged, and applications that need certificate validation should always use `verify-ca` or `verify-full`.

### Client Certificates

If the server attempts to verify the identity of the client by requesting the client's leaf certificate, libpq will send the certificate(s) stored in file `~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt` in the user's home directory. The certificates must chain to the root certificate trusted by the server. A matching private key file `~/.postgresql/postgresql.key` must also be present. On Microsoft Windows these files are named `%APPDATA%\postgresql\postgresql.crt` and `%APPDATA%\postgresql\postgresql.key`. The location of the certificate and key files can be overridden by the connection parameters `sslcert` and `sslkey`, or by the environment variables `PGSSLCERT` and `PGSSLKEY`.

On Unix systems, the permissions on the private key file must disallow any access to world or group; achieve this by a command such as `chmod 0600 ~/.postgresql/postgresql.key`. Alternatively, the file can be owned by root and have group read access (that is, `0640` permissions). That setup is intended for installations where certificate and key files are managed by the operating system. The user of libpq should then be made a member of the group that has access to those certificate and key files. (On Microsoft Windows, there is no file permissions check, since the `%APPDATA%\postgresql` directory is presumed secure.)

The first certificate in `postgresql.crt` must be the client's certificate because it must match the client's private key. “Intermediate” certificates can be optionally appended to the file doing so avoids requiring storage of intermediate certificates on the server ([???](#guc-ssl-ca-file)).

The certificate and key may be in PEM or ASN.1 DER format.

The key may be stored in cleartext or encrypted with a passphrase using any algorithm supported by OpenSSL, like AES-128. If the key is stored encrypted, then the passphrase may be provided in the [sslpassword](#libpq-connect-sslpassword) connection option. If an encrypted key is supplied and the `sslpassword` option is absent or blank, a password will be prompted for interactively by OpenSSL with a `Enter PEM pass phrase:` prompt if a TTY is available. Applications can override the client certificate prompt and the handling of the `sslpassword` parameter by supplying their own key password callback; see [varlistentry_title](#libpq-pqsetsslkeypasshook-openssl).

For instructions on creating certificates, see [???](#ssl-certificate-creation).

### Protection Provided in Different Modes

The different values for the `sslmode` parameter provide different levels of protection. SSL can provide protection against three types of attacks:

Eavesdropping  
If a third party can examine the network traffic between the client and the server, it can read both connection information (including the user name and password) and the data that is passed. SSL uses encryption to prevent this.

Man-in-the-middle (MITM)  
If a third party can modify the data while passing between the client and server, it can pretend to be the server and therefore see and modify data *even if it is encrypted*. The third party can then forward the connection information and data to the original server, making it impossible to detect this attack. Common vectors to do this include DNS poisoning and address hijacking, whereby the client is directed to a different server than intended. There are also several other attack methods that can accomplish this. SSL uses certificate verification to prevent this, by authenticating the server to the client.

Impersonation  
If a third party can pretend to be an authorized client, it can simply access data it should not have access to. Typically this can happen through insecure password management. SSL uses client certificates to prevent this, by making sure that only holders of valid certificates can access the server.

For a connection to be known SSL-secured, SSL usage must be configured on *both the client and the server* before the connection is made. If it is only configured on the server, the client may end up sending sensitive information (e.g., passwords) before it knows that the server requires high security. In libpq, secure connections can be ensured by setting the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` or `verify-ca`, and providing the system with a root certificate to verify against. This is analogous to using an `https` URL for encrypted web browsing.

Once the server has been authenticated, the client can pass sensitive data. This means that up until this point, the client does not need to know if certificates will be used for authentication, making it safe to specify that only in the server configuration.

All SSL options carry overhead in the form of encryption and key-exchange, so there is a trade-off that has to be made between performance and security. [SSL Mode Descriptions](#libpq-ssl-sslmode-statements) illustrates the risks the different `sslmode` values protect against, and what statement they make about security and overhead.

| `sslmode` | Eavesdropping protection | MITM protection | Statement |
|----|----|----|----|
| `disable` | No | No | I don't care about security, and I don't want to pay the overhead of encryption. |
| `allow` | Maybe | No | I don't care about security, but I will pay the overhead of encryption if the server insists on it. |
| `prefer` | Maybe | No | I don't care about encryption, but I wish to pay the overhead of encryption if the server supports it. |
| `require` | Yes | No | I want my data to be encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I trust that the network will make sure I always connect to the server I want. |
| `verify-ca` | Yes | Depends on CA policy | I want my data encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I want to be sure that I connect to a server that I trust. |
| `verify-full` | Yes | Yes | I want my data encrypted, and I accept the overhead. I want to be sure that I connect to a server I trust, and that it's the one I specify. |

SSL Mode Descriptions {#libpq-ssl-sslmode-statements}

The difference between `verify-ca` and `verify-full` depends on the policy of the root CA. If a public CA is used, `verify-ca` allows connections to a server that *somebody else* may have registered with the CA. In this case, `verify-full` should always be used. If a local CA is used, or even a self-signed certificate, using `verify-ca` often provides enough protection.

The default value for `sslmode` is `prefer`. As is shown in the table, this makes no sense from a security point of view, and it only promises performance overhead if possible. It is only provided as the default for backward compatibility, and is not recommended in secure deployments.

### SSL Client File Usage

[Libpq/Client SSL File Usage](#libpq-ssl-file-usage) summarizes the files that are relevant to the SSL setup on the client.

| File | Contents | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| `~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt` | client certificate | sent to server |
| `~/.postgresql/postgresql.key` | client private key | proves client certificate sent by owner; does not indicate certificate owner is trustworthy |
| `~/.postgresql/root.crt` | trusted certificate authorities | checks that server certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority |
| `~/.postgresql/root.crl` | certificates revoked by certificate authorities | server certificate must not be on this list |

Libpq/Client SSL File Usage {#libpq-ssl-file-usage}

### SSL Library Initialization

If your application initializes `libssl` and/or `libcrypto` libraries and libpq is built with SSL support, you should call [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinitOpenSSL) to tell libpq that the `libssl` and/or `libcrypto` libraries have been initialized by your application, so that libpq will not also initialize those libraries. However, this is unnecessary when using OpenSSL version 1.1.0 or later, as duplicate initializations are no longer problematic.

`PQinitOpenSSL`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Allows applications to select which security libraries to initialize. void PQinitOpenSSL(int do_ssl, int do_crypto);

When `do_ssl` is non-zero, libpq will initialize the OpenSSL library before first opening a database connection. When `do_crypto` is non-zero, the `libcrypto` library will be initialized. By default (if [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinitOpenSSL) is not called), both libraries are initialized. When SSL support is not compiled in, this function is present but does nothing.

If your application uses and initializes either OpenSSL or its underlying `libcrypto` library, you *must* call this function with zeroes for the appropriate parameter(s) before first opening a database connection. Also be sure that you have done that initialization before opening a database connection.

`PQinitSSL`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Allows applications to select which security libraries to initialize. void PQinitSSL(int do_ssl);

This function is equivalent to `PQinitOpenSSL(do_ssl, do_ssl)`. It is sufficient for applications that initialize both or neither of OpenSSL and `libcrypto`.

[varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinitSSL) has been present since PostgreSQL 8.0, while [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinitOpenSSL) was added in PostgreSQL 8.4, so [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQinitSSL) might be preferable for applications that need to work with older versions of libpq.

## Behavior in Threaded Programs

threads

with libpq

As of version 17, libpq is always reentrant and thread-safe. However, one restriction is that no two threads attempt to manipulate the same PGconn object at the same time. In particular, you cannot issue concurrent commands from different threads through the same connection object. (If you need to run concurrent commands, use multiple connections.)

PGresult objects are normally read-only after creation, and so can be passed around freely between threads. However, if you use any of the PGresult-modifying functions described in [Miscellaneous Functions](#libpq-misc) or [Event System](#libpq-events), it's up to you to avoid concurrent operations on the same PGresult, too.

In earlier versions, libpq could be compiled with or without thread support, depending on compiler options. This function allows the querying of libpq's thread-safe status:

`PQisthreadsafe`<span class="indexterm"></span>  
Returns the thread safety status of the libpq library. int PQisthreadsafe();

Returns 1 if the libpq is thread-safe and 0 if it is not. Always returns 1 on version 17 and above.

The deprecated functions [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQrequestCancel) and [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQoidStatus) are not thread-safe and should not be used in multithread programs. [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQrequestCancel) can be replaced by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQcancelBlocking). [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQoidStatus) can be replaced by [varlistentry_title](#libpq-PQoidValue).

If you are using Kerberos inside your application (in addition to inside libpq), you will need to do locking around Kerberos calls because Kerberos functions are not thread-safe. See function `PQregisterThreadLock` in the libpq source code for a way to do cooperative locking between libpq and your application.

## Building libpq Programs

compiling

libpq applications

To build (i.e., compile and link) a program using libpq you need to do all of the following things:

- Include the `libpq-fe.h` header file:

      #include <libpq-fe.h>

  If you failed to do that then you will normally get error messages from your compiler similar to:

      foo.c: In function `main':
      foo.c:34: `PGconn' undeclared (first use in this function)
      foo.c:35: `PGresult' undeclared (first use in this function)
      foo.c:54: `CONNECTION_BAD' undeclared (first use in this function)
      foo.c:68: `PGRES_COMMAND_OK' undeclared (first use in this function)
      foo.c:95: `PGRES_TUPLES_OK' undeclared (first use in this function)

- Point your compiler to the directory where the PostgreSQL header files were installed, by supplying the `-Idirectory` option to your compiler. (In some cases the compiler will look into the directory in question by default, so you can omit this option.) For instance, your compile command line could look like:

      cc -c -I/usr/local/pgsql/include testprog.c

  If you are using makefiles then add the option to the `CPPFLAGS` variable:

      CPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/pgsql/include

  If there is any chance that your program might be compiled by other users then you should not hardcode the directory location like that. Instead, you can run the utility `pg_config`<span class="indexterm"></span> to find out where the header files are on the local system:

      $ pg_config --includedir
      /usr/local/include

  If you have `pkg-config`<span class="indexterm"></span> installed, you can run instead:

      $ pkg-config --cflags libpq
      -I/usr/local/include

  Note that this will already include the `-I` in front of the path.

  Failure to specify the correct option to the compiler will result in an error message such as:

      testlibpq.c:8:22: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory

- When linking the final program, specify the option `-lpq` so that the libpq library gets pulled in, as well as the option `-Ldirectory` to point the compiler to the directory where the libpq library resides. (Again, the compiler will search some directories by default.) For maximum portability, put the `-L` option before the `-lpq` option. For example:

      cc -o testprog testprog1.o testprog2.o -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lpq

  You can find out the library directory using `pg_config` as well:

      $ pg_config --libdir
      /usr/local/pgsql/lib

  Or again use `pkg-config`:

      $ pkg-config --libs libpq
      -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lpq

  Note again that this prints the full options, not only the path.

  Error messages that point to problems in this area could look like the following:

      testlibpq.o: In function `main':
      testlibpq.o(.text+0x60): undefined reference to `PQsetdbLogin'
      testlibpq.o(.text+0x71): undefined reference to `PQstatus'
      testlibpq.o(.text+0xa4): undefined reference to `PQerrorMessage'

  This means you forgot `-lpq`.

      /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpq

  This means you forgot the `-L` option or did not specify the right directory.

[^1]: The client will block trying to send queries to the server, but the server will block trying to send results to the client from queries it has already processed. This only occurs when the client sends enough queries to fill both its output buffer and the server's receive buffer before it switches to processing input from the server, but it's hard to predict exactly when that will happen.
