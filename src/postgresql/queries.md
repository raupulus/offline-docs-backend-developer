## Queries

query

SELECT

The previous chapters explained how to create tables, how to fill them with data, and how to manipulate that data. Now we finally discuss how to retrieve the data from the database.

## Overview

The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. In SQL the [`SELECT`](#sql-select) command is used to specify queries. The general syntax of the `SELECT` command is \[WITH \<with_queries\>\] SELECT \<select_list\> FROM \<table_expression\> \[\<sort_specification\>\] The following sections describe the details of the select list, the table expression, and the sort specification. `WITH` queries are treated last since they are an advanced feature.

A simple kind of query has the form:

    SELECT * FROM table1;

Assuming that there is a table called `table1`, this command would retrieve all rows and all user-defined columns from `table1`. (The method of retrieval depends on the client application. For example, the psql program will display an ASCII-art table on the screen, while client libraries will offer functions to extract individual values from the query result.) The select list specification `*` means all columns that the table expression happens to provide. A select list can also select a subset of the available columns or make calculations using the columns. For example, if `table1` has columns named `a`, `b`, and `c` (and perhaps others) you can make the following query:

    SELECT a, b + c FROM table1;

(assuming that `b` and `c` are of a numerical data type). See [Select Lists](#queries-select-lists) for more details.

`FROM table1` is a simple kind of table expression: it reads just one table. In general, table expressions can be complex constructs of base tables, joins, and subqueries. But you can also omit the table expression entirely and use the `SELECT` command as a calculator:

    SELECT 3 * 4;

This is more useful if the expressions in the select list return varying results. For example, you could call a function this way:

    SELECT random();

## Table Expressions

table expression

A table expression computes a table. The table expression contains a `FROM` clause that is optionally followed by `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses. Trivial table expressions simply refer to a table on disk, a so-called base table, but more complex expressions can be used to modify or combine base tables in various ways.

The optional `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses in the table expression specify a pipeline of successive transformations performed on the table derived in the `FROM` clause. All these transformations produce a virtual table that provides the rows that are passed to the select list to compute the output rows of the query.

### The `FROM` Clause

The [`FROM`](#sql-from) clause derives a table from one or more other tables given in a comma-separated table reference list. FROM \<table_reference\> \[, \<table_reference\> \[, ...\]\] A table reference can be a table name (possibly schema-qualified), or a derived table such as a subquery, a `JOIN` construct, or complex combinations of these. If more than one table reference is listed in the `FROM` clause, the tables are cross-joined (that is, the Cartesian product of their rows is formed; see below). The result of the `FROM` list is an intermediate virtual table that can then be subject to transformations by the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses and is finally the result of the overall table expression.

ONLY

When a table reference names a table that is the parent of a table inheritance hierarchy, the table reference produces rows of not only that table but all of its descendant tables, unless the key word `ONLY` precedes the table name. However, the reference produces only the columns that appear in the named table any columns added in subtables are ignored.

Instead of writing `ONLY` before the table name, you can write `*` after the table name to explicitly specify that descendant tables are included. There is no real reason to use this syntax any more, because searching descendant tables is now always the default behavior. However, it is supported for compatibility with older releases.

#### Joined Tables

join

A joined table is a table derived from two other (real or derived) tables according to the rules of the particular join type. Inner, outer, and cross-joins are available. The general syntax of a joined table is \<T1\> \<join_type\> \<T2\> \[\<join_condition\>\] Joins of all types can be chained together, or nested: either or both \<T1\> and \<T2\> can be joined tables. Parentheses can be used around `JOIN` clauses to control the join order. In the absence of parentheses, `JOIN` clauses nest left-to-right.

Cross join <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
T1

CROSS JOIN

T2

For every possible combination of rows from \<T1\> and \<T2\> (i.e., a Cartesian product), the joined table will contain a row consisting of all columns in \<T1\> followed by all columns in \<T2\>. If the tables have N and M rows respectively, the joined table will have N \* M rows.

`FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T2` is equivalent to `FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON TRUE` (see below). It is also equivalent to `FROM T1, T2`.

> [!NOTE]
> This latter equivalence does not hold exactly when more than two tables appear, because `JOIN` binds more tightly than comma. For example `FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T2 INNER JOIN T3 ON condition` is not the same as `FROM T1, T2 INNER JOIN T3 ON condition` because the \<condition\> can reference \<T1\> in the first case but not the second.

The words `INNER` and `OUTER` are optional in all forms. `INNER` is the default; `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL` imply an outer join.

The join condition is specified in the `ON` or `USING` clause, or implicitly by the word `NATURAL`. The join condition determines which rows from the two source tables are considered to “match”, as explained in detail below.

The possible types of qualified join are:

`INNER JOIN`  
For each row R1 of T1, the joined table has a row for each row in T2 that satisfies the join condition with R1.

`LEFT OUTER JOIN` <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
First, an inner join is performed. Then, for each row in T1 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T2, a joined row is added with null values in columns of T2. Thus, the joined table always has at least one row for each row in T1.

`RIGHT OUTER JOIN` <span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
First, an inner join is performed. Then, for each row in T2 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T1, a joined row is added with null values in columns of T1. This is the converse of a left join: the result table will always have a row for each row in T2.

`FULL OUTER JOIN`  
First, an inner join is performed. Then, for each row in T1 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T2, a joined row is added with null values in columns of T2. Also, for each row of T2 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T1, a joined row with null values in the columns of T1 is added.

The `ON` clause is the most general kind of join condition: it takes a Boolean value expression of the same kind as is used in a `WHERE` clause. A pair of rows from \<T1\> and \<T2\> match if the `ON` expression evaluates to true.

The `USING` clause is a shorthand that allows you to take advantage of the specific situation where both sides of the join use the same name for the joining column(s). It takes a comma-separated list of the shared column names and forms a join condition that includes an equality comparison for each one. For example, joining \<T1\> and \<T2\> with `USING (a, b)` produces the join condition `ON T1.a = T2.a AND T1.b = T2.b`.

Furthermore, the output of `JOIN USING` suppresses redundant columns: there is no need to print both of the matched columns, since they must have equal values. While `JOIN ON` produces all columns from \<T1\> followed by all columns from \<T2\>, `JOIN USING` produces one output column for each of the listed column pairs (in the listed order), followed by any remaining columns from \<T1\>, followed by any remaining columns from \<T2\>.

<span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span> Finally, `NATURAL` is a shorthand form of `USING`: it forms a `USING` list consisting of all column names that appear in both input tables. As with `USING`, these columns appear only once in the output table. If there are no common column names, `NATURAL JOIN` behaves like `CROSS JOIN`.

> [!NOTE]
> `USING` is reasonably safe from column changes in the joined relations since only the listed columns are combined. `NATURAL` is considerably more risky since any schema changes to either relation that cause a new matching column name to be present will cause the join to combine that new column as well.

To put this together, assume we have tables `t1`:

     num | name
    -----+------
       1 | a
       2 | b
       3 | c

and `t2`:

     num | value
    -----+-------
       1 | xxx
       3 | yyy
       5 | zzz

then we get the following results for the various joins:

    => SELECT * FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       1 | a    |   3 | yyy
       1 | a    |   5 | zzz
       2 | b    |   1 | xxx
       2 | b    |   3 | yyy
       2 | b    |   5 | zzz
       3 | c    |   1 | xxx
       3 | c    |   3 | yyy
       3 | c    |   5 | zzz
    (9 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       3 | c    |   3 | yyy
    (2 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 USING (num);
     num | name | value
    -----+------+-------
       1 | a    | xxx
       3 | c    | yyy
    (2 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL INNER JOIN t2;
     num | name | value
    -----+------+-------
       1 | a    | xxx
       3 | c    | yyy
    (2 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       2 | b    |     |
       3 | c    |   3 | yyy
    (3 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (num);
     num | name | value
    -----+------+-------
       1 | a    | xxx
       2 | b    |
       3 | c    | yyy
    (3 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       3 | c    |   3 | yyy
         |      |   5 | zzz
    (3 rows)

    => SELECT * FROM t1 FULL JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       2 | b    |     |
       3 | c    |   3 | yyy
         |      |   5 | zzz
    (4 rows)

The join condition specified with `ON` can also contain conditions that do not relate directly to the join. This can prove useful for some queries but needs to be thought out carefully. For example:

    => SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num AND t2.value = 'xxx';
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
       2 | b    |     |
       3 | c    |     |
    (3 rows)

Notice that placing the restriction in the `WHERE` clause produces a different result:

    => SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num WHERE t2.value = 'xxx';
     num | name | num | value
    -----+------+-----+-------
       1 | a    |   1 | xxx
    (1 row)

This is because a restriction placed in the `ON` clause is processed *before* the join, while a restriction placed in the `WHERE` clause is processed *after* the join. That does not matter with inner joins, but it matters a lot with outer joins.

#### Table and Column Aliases

alias

in the FROM clause

label

alias

A temporary name can be given to tables and complex table references to be used for references to the derived table in the rest of the query. This is called a table alias.

To create a table alias, write FROM \<table_reference\> AS \<alias\> or FROM \<table_reference\> \<alias\> The `AS` key word is optional noise. \<alias\> can be any identifier.

A typical application of table aliases is to assign short identifiers to long table names to keep the join clauses readable. For example:

    SELECT * FROM some_very_long_table_name s JOIN another_fairly_long_name a ON s.id = a.num;

The alias becomes the new name of the table reference so far as the current query is concerned it is not allowed to refer to the table by the original name elsewhere in the query. Thus, this is not valid:

    SELECT * FROM my_table AS m WHERE my_table.a > 5;    -- wrong

Table aliases are mainly for notational convenience, but it is necessary to use them when joining a table to itself, e.g.:

    SELECT * FROM people AS mother JOIN people AS child ON mother.id = child.mother_id;

Parentheses are used to resolve ambiguities. In the following example, the first statement assigns the alias `b` to the second instance of `my_table`, but the second statement assigns the alias to the result of the join:

    SELECT * FROM my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table AS b ...
    SELECT * FROM (my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table) AS b ...

Another form of table aliasing gives temporary names to the columns of the table, as well as the table itself: FROM \<table_reference\> \[AS\] \<alias\> ( \<column1\> \[, \<column2\> \[, ...\]\] ) If fewer column aliases are specified than the actual table has columns, the remaining columns are not renamed. This syntax is especially useful for self-joins or subqueries.

When an alias is applied to the output of a `JOIN` clause, the alias hides the original name(s) within the `JOIN`. For example:

    SELECT a.* FROM my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...

is valid SQL, but:

    SELECT a.* FROM (my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...) AS c

is not valid; the table alias `a` is not visible outside the alias `c`.

#### Subqueries

subquery

Subqueries specifying a derived table must be enclosed in parentheses. They may be assigned a table alias name, and optionally column alias names (as in [Table and Column Aliases](#queries-table-aliases)). For example:

    FROM (SELECT * FROM table1) AS alias_name

This example is equivalent to `FROM table1 AS alias_name`. More interesting cases, which cannot be reduced to a plain join, arise when the subquery involves grouping or aggregation.

A subquery can also be a `VALUES` list:

    FROM (VALUES ('anne', 'smith'), ('bob', 'jones'), ('joe', 'blow'))
         AS names(first, last)

Again, a table alias is optional. Assigning alias names to the columns of the `VALUES` list is optional, but is good practice. For more information see [ Lists](#queries-values).

According to the SQL standard, a table alias name must be supplied for a subquery. PostgreSQL allows `AS` and the alias to be omitted, but writing one is good practice in SQL code that might be ported to another system.

#### Table Functions

table function

function

in the FROM clause

Table functions are functions that produce a set of rows, made up of either base data types (scalar types) or composite data types (table rows). They are used like a table, view, or subquery in the `FROM` clause of a query. Columns returned by table functions can be included in `SELECT`, `JOIN`, or `WHERE` clauses in the same manner as columns of a table, view, or subquery.

Table functions may also be combined using the `ROWS FROM` syntax, with the results returned in parallel columns; the number of result rows in this case is that of the largest function result, with smaller results padded with null values to match.

function_call

WITH ORDINALITY

AS

table_alias

(

column_alias

, ...

)

ROWS FROM(

function_call

, ...

)

WITH ORDINALITY

AS

table_alias

(

column_alias

, ...

)

If the `WITH ORDINALITY` clause is specified, an additional column of type `bigint` will be added to the function result columns. This column numbers the rows of the function result set, starting from 1. (This is a generalization of the SQL-standard syntax for `UNNEST ... WITH ORDINALITY`.) By default, the ordinal column is called `ordinality`, but a different column name can be assigned to it using an `AS` clause.

The special table function `UNNEST` may be called with any number of array parameters, and it returns a corresponding number of columns, as if `UNNEST` ([???](#functions-array)) had been called on each parameter separately and combined using the `ROWS FROM` construct.

UNNEST(

array_expression

, ...

)

WITH ORDINALITY

AS

table_alias

(

column_alias

, ...

)

If no \<table_alias\> is specified, the function name is used as the table name; in the case of a `ROWS FROM()` construct, the first function's name is used.

If column aliases are not supplied, then for a function returning a base data type, the column name is also the same as the function name. For a function returning a composite type, the result columns get the names of the individual attributes of the type.

Some examples:

    CREATE TABLE foo (fooid int, foosubid int, fooname text);

    CREATE FUNCTION getfoo(int) RETURNS SETOF foo AS $$
        SELECT * FROM foo WHERE fooid = $1;
    $$ LANGUAGE SQL;

    SELECT * FROM getfoo(1) AS t1;

    SELECT * FROM foo
        WHERE foosubid IN (
                            SELECT foosubid
                            FROM getfoo(foo.fooid) z
                            WHERE z.fooid = foo.fooid
                          );

    CREATE VIEW vw_getfoo AS SELECT * FROM getfoo(1);

    SELECT * FROM vw_getfoo;

In some cases it is useful to define table functions that can return different column sets depending on how they are invoked. To support this, the table function can be declared as returning the pseudo-type `record` with no `OUT` parameters. When such a function is used in a query, the expected row structure must be specified in the query itself, so that the system can know how to parse and plan the query. This syntax looks like:

function_call

AS

alias

(

column_definition

, ...

)

function_call

AS

alias

(

column_definition

, ...

) ROWS FROM( ...

function_call

AS (

column_definition

, ...

)

, ...

)

When not using the `ROWS FROM()` syntax, the \<column_definition\> list replaces the column alias list that could otherwise be attached to the `FROM` item; the names in the column definitions serve as column aliases. When using the `ROWS FROM()` syntax, a \<column_definition\> list can be attached to each member function separately; or if there is only one member function and no `WITH ORDINALITY` clause, a \<column_definition\> list can be written in place of a column alias list following `ROWS FROM()`.

Consider this example:

    SELECT *
        FROM dblink('dbname=mydb', 'SELECT proname, prosrc FROM pg_proc')
          AS t1(proname name, prosrc text)
        WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';

The [???](#contrib-dblink-function) function (part of the [???](#dblink) module) executes a remote query. It is declared to return `record` since it might be used for any kind of query. The actual column set must be specified in the calling query so that the parser knows, for example, what `*` should expand to.

This example uses `ROWS FROM`:

    SELECT *
    FROM ROWS FROM
        (
            json_to_recordset('[{"a":40,"b":"foo"},{"a":"100","b":"bar"}]')
                AS (a INTEGER, b TEXT),
            generate_series(1, 3)
        ) AS x (p, q, s)
    ORDER BY p;

      p  |  q  | s
    -----+-----+---
      40 | foo | 1
     100 | bar | 2
         |     | 3

It joins two functions into a single `FROM` target. `json_to_recordset()` is instructed to return two columns, the first `integer` and the second `text`. The result of `generate_series()` is used directly. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the column values as integers.

#### `LATERAL` Subqueries

LATERAL

in the FROM clause

Subqueries appearing in `FROM` can be preceded by the key word `LATERAL`. This allows them to reference columns provided by preceding `FROM` items. (Without `LATERAL`, each subquery is evaluated independently and so cannot cross-reference any other `FROM` item.)

Table functions appearing in `FROM` can also be preceded by the key word `LATERAL`, but for functions the key word is optional; the function's arguments can contain references to columns provided by preceding `FROM` items in any case.

A `LATERAL` item can appear at the top level in the `FROM` list, or within a `JOIN` tree. In the latter case it can also refer to any items that are on the left-hand side of a `JOIN` that it is on the right-hand side of.

When a `FROM` item contains `LATERAL` cross-references, evaluation proceeds as follows: for each row of the `FROM` item providing the cross-referenced column(s), or set of rows of multiple `FROM` items providing the columns, the `LATERAL` item is evaluated using that row or row set's values of the columns. The resulting row(s) are joined as usual with the rows they were computed from. This is repeated for each row or set of rows from the column source table(s).

A trivial example of `LATERAL` is

    SELECT * FROM foo, LATERAL (SELECT * FROM bar WHERE bar.id = foo.bar_id) ss;

This is not especially useful since it has exactly the same result as the more conventional

    SELECT * FROM foo, bar WHERE bar.id = foo.bar_id;

`LATERAL` is primarily useful when the cross-referenced column is necessary for computing the row(s) to be joined. A common application is providing an argument value for a set-returning function. For example, supposing that `vertices(polygon)` returns the set of vertices of a polygon, we could identify close-together vertices of polygons stored in a table with:

    SELECT p1.id, p2.id, v1, v2
    FROM polygons p1, polygons p2,
         LATERAL vertices(p1.poly) v1,
         LATERAL vertices(p2.poly) v2
    WHERE (v1 <-> v2) < 10 AND p1.id != p2.id;

This query could also be written

    SELECT p1.id, p2.id, v1, v2
    FROM polygons p1 CROSS JOIN LATERAL vertices(p1.poly) v1,
         polygons p2 CROSS JOIN LATERAL vertices(p2.poly) v2
    WHERE (v1 <-> v2) < 10 AND p1.id != p2.id;

or in several other equivalent formulations. (As already mentioned, the `LATERAL` key word is unnecessary in this example, but we use it for clarity.)

It is often particularly handy to `LEFT JOIN` to a `LATERAL` subquery, so that source rows will appear in the result even if the `LATERAL` subquery produces no rows for them. For example, if `get_product_names()` returns the names of products made by a manufacturer, but some manufacturers in our table currently produce no products, we could find out which ones those are like this:

    SELECT m.name
    FROM manufacturers m LEFT JOIN LATERAL get_product_names(m.id) pname ON true
    WHERE pname IS NULL;

### The `WHERE` Clause

WHERE

The syntax of the [`WHERE`](#sql-where) clause is WHERE \<search_condition\> where \<search_condition\> is any value expression (see [???](#sql-expressions)) that returns a value of type `boolean`.

After the processing of the `FROM` clause is done, each row of the derived virtual table is checked against the search condition. If the result of the condition is true, the row is kept in the output table, otherwise (i.e., if the result is false or null) it is discarded. The search condition typically references at least one column of the table generated in the `FROM` clause; this is not required, but otherwise the `WHERE` clause will be fairly useless.

> [!NOTE]
> The join condition of an inner join can be written either in the `WHERE` clause or in the `JOIN` clause. For example, these table expressions are equivalent:
>
>     FROM a, b WHERE a.id = b.id AND b.val > 5
>
> and:
>
>     FROM a INNER JOIN b ON (a.id = b.id) WHERE b.val > 5
>
> or perhaps even:
>
>     FROM a NATURAL JOIN b WHERE b.val > 5
>
> Which one of these you use is mainly a matter of style. The `JOIN` syntax in the `FROM` clause is probably not as portable to other SQL database management systems, even though it is in the SQL standard. For outer joins there is no choice: they must be done in the `FROM` clause. The `ON` or `USING` clause of an outer join is *not* equivalent to a `WHERE` condition, because it results in the addition of rows (for unmatched input rows) as well as the removal of rows in the final result.

Here are some examples of `WHERE` clauses:

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 > 5

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (1, 2, 3)

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c1 FROM t2)

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10)

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 BETWEEN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10) AND 100

    SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE EXISTS (SELECT c1 FROM t2 WHERE c2 > fdt.c1)

`fdt` is the table derived in the `FROM` clause. Rows that do not meet the search condition of the `WHERE` clause are eliminated from `fdt`. Notice the use of scalar subqueries as value expressions. Just like any other query, the subqueries can employ complex table expressions. Notice also how `fdt` is referenced in the subqueries. Qualifying `c1` as `fdt.c1` is only necessary if `c1` is also the name of a column in the derived input table of the subquery. But qualifying the column name adds clarity even when it is not needed. This example shows how the column naming scope of an outer query extends into its inner queries.

### The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` Clauses

GROUP BY

After passing the `WHERE` filter, the derived input table might be subject to grouping, using the `GROUP BY` clause, and elimination of group rows using the `HAVING` clause.

The [`GROUP BY`](#sql-groupby) clause is used to group together those rows in a table that have the same values in all the columns listed. The order in which the columns are listed does not matter. The effect is to combine each set of rows having common values into one group row that represents all rows in the group. This is done to eliminate redundancy in the output and/or compute aggregates that apply to these groups. For instance:

    => SELECT * FROM test1;
     x | y
    ---+---
     a | 3
     c | 2
     b | 5
     a | 1
    (4 rows)

    => SELECT x FROM test1 GROUP BY x;
     x
    ---
     a
     b
     c
    (3 rows)

In the second query, we could not have written `SELECT * FROM test1 GROUP BY x`, because there is no single value for the column `y` that could be associated with each group. The grouped-by columns can be referenced in the select list since they have a single value in each group.

In general, if a table is grouped, columns that are not listed in `GROUP BY` cannot be referenced except in aggregate expressions. An example with aggregate expressions is:

    => SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x;
     x | sum
    ---+-----
     a |   4
     b |   5
     c |   2
    (3 rows)

Here `sum` is an aggregate function that computes a single value over the entire group. More information about the available aggregate functions can be found in [???](#functions-aggregate).

> [!TIP]
> Grouping without aggregate expressions effectively calculates the set of distinct values in a column. This can also be achieved using the `DISTINCT` clause (see [](#queries-distinct)).

Here is another example: it calculates the total sales for each product (rather than the total sales of all products):

    SELECT product_id, p.name, (sum(s.units) * p.price) AS sales
        FROM products p LEFT JOIN sales s USING (product_id)
        GROUP BY product_id, p.name, p.price;

In this example, the columns `product_id`, `p.name`, and `p.price` must be in the `GROUP BY` clause since they are referenced in the query select list (but see below). The column `s.units` does not have to be in the `GROUP BY` list since it is only used in an aggregate expression (`sum(...)`), which represents the sales of a product. For each product, the query returns a summary row about all sales of the product.

functional dependency

If the products table is set up so that, say, `product_id` is the primary key, then it would be enough to group by `product_id` in the above example, since name and price would be functionally dependent on the product ID, and so there would be no ambiguity about which name and price value to return for each product ID group.

In strict SQL, `GROUP BY` can only group by columns of the source table but PostgreSQL extends this to also allow `GROUP BY` to group by columns in the select list. Grouping by value expressions instead of simple column names is also allowed.

HAVING

If a table has been grouped using `GROUP BY`, but only certain groups are of interest, the `HAVING` clause can be used, much like a `WHERE` clause, to eliminate groups from the result. The syntax is: SELECT \<select_list\> FROM ... \[WHERE ...\] GROUP BY ... HAVING \<boolean_expression\> Expressions in the `HAVING` clause can refer both to grouped expressions and to ungrouped expressions (which necessarily involve an aggregate function).

Example:

    => SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x HAVING sum(y) > 3;
     x | sum
    ---+-----
     a |   4
     b |   5
    (2 rows)

    => SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x HAVING x < 'c';
     x | sum
    ---+-----
     a |   4
     b |   5
    (2 rows)

Again, a more realistic example:

    SELECT product_id, p.name, (sum(s.units) * (p.price - p.cost)) AS profit
        FROM products p LEFT JOIN sales s USING (product_id)
        WHERE s.date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 weeks'
        GROUP BY product_id, p.name, p.price, p.cost
        HAVING sum(p.price * s.units) > 5000;

In the example above, the `WHERE` clause is selecting rows by a column that is not grouped (the expression is only true for sales during the last four weeks), while the `HAVING` clause restricts the output to groups with total gross sales over 5000. Note that the aggregate expressions do not necessarily need to be the same in all parts of the query.

If a query contains aggregate function calls, but no `GROUP BY` clause, grouping still occurs: the result is a single group row (or perhaps no rows at all, if the single row is then eliminated by `HAVING`). The same is true if it contains a `HAVING` clause, even without any aggregate function calls or `GROUP BY` clause.

### `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`, and `ROLLUP`

GROUPING SETS

CUBE

ROLLUP

More complex grouping operations than those described above are possible using the concept of grouping sets. The data selected by the `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses is grouped separately by each specified grouping set, aggregates computed for each group just as for simple `GROUP BY` clauses, and then the results returned. For example:

    => SELECT * FROM items_sold;
     brand | size | sales
    -------+------+-------
     Foo   | L    |  10
     Foo   | M    |  20
     Bar   | M    |  15
     Bar   | L    |  5
    (4 rows)

    => SELECT brand, size, sum(sales) FROM items_sold GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((brand), (size), ());
     brand | size | sum
    -------+------+-----
     Foo   |      |  30
     Bar   |      |  20
           | L    |  15
           | M    |  35
           |      |  50
    (5 rows)

Each sublist of `GROUPING SETS` may specify zero or more columns or expressions and is interpreted the same way as though it were directly in the `GROUP BY` clause. An empty grouping set means that all rows are aggregated down to a single group (which is output even if no input rows were present), as described above for the case of aggregate functions with no `GROUP BY` clause.

References to the grouping columns or expressions are replaced by null values in result rows for grouping sets in which those columns do not appear. To distinguish which grouping a particular output row resulted from, see [???](#functions-grouping-table).

A shorthand notation is provided for specifying two common types of grouping set. A clause of the form

    ROLLUP ( e1, e2, e3, ... )

represents the given list of expressions and all prefixes of the list including the empty list; thus it is equivalent to

    GROUPING SETS (
        ( e1, e2, e3, ... ),
        ...
        ( e1, e2 ),
        ( e1 ),
        ( )
    )

This is commonly used for analysis over hierarchical data; e.g., total salary by department, division, and company-wide total.

A clause of the form

    CUBE ( e1, e2, ... )

represents the given list and all of its possible subsets (i.e., the power set). Thus

    CUBE ( a, b, c )

is equivalent to

    GROUPING SETS (
        ( a, b, c ),
        ( a, b    ),
        ( a,    c ),
        ( a       ),
        (    b, c ),
        (    b    ),
        (       c ),
        (         )
    )

The individual elements of a `CUBE` or `ROLLUP` clause may be either individual expressions, or sublists of elements in parentheses. In the latter case, the sublists are treated as single units for the purposes of generating the individual grouping sets. For example:

    CUBE ( (a, b), (c, d) )

is equivalent to

    GROUPING SETS (
        ( a, b, c, d ),
        ( a, b       ),
        (       c, d ),
        (            )
    )

and

    ROLLUP ( a, (b, c), d )

is equivalent to

    GROUPING SETS (
        ( a, b, c, d ),
        ( a, b, c    ),
        ( a          ),
        (            )
    )

The `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` constructs can be used either directly in the `GROUP BY` clause, or nested inside a `GROUPING SETS` clause. If one `GROUPING SETS` clause is nested inside another, the effect is the same as if all the elements of the inner clause had been written directly in the outer clause.

If multiple grouping items are specified in a single `GROUP BY` clause, then the final list of grouping sets is the Cartesian product of the individual items. For example:

    GROUP BY a, CUBE (b, c), GROUPING SETS ((d), (e))

is equivalent to

    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
        (a, b, c, d), (a, b, c, e),
        (a, b, d),    (a, b, e),
        (a, c, d),    (a, c, e),
        (a, d),       (a, e)
    )

<span class="indexterm"></span> <span class="indexterm"></span> When specifying multiple grouping items together, the final set of grouping sets might contain duplicates. For example:

    GROUP BY ROLLUP (a, b), ROLLUP (a, c)

is equivalent to

    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
        (a, b, c),
        (a, b),
        (a, b),
        (a, c),
        (a),
        (a),
        (a, c),
        (a),
        ()
    )

If these duplicates are undesirable, they can be removed using the `DISTINCT` clause directly on the `GROUP BY`. Therefore:

    GROUP BY DISTINCT ROLLUP (a, b), ROLLUP (a, c)

is equivalent to

    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
        (a, b, c),
        (a, b),
        (a, c),
        (a),
        ()
    )

This is not the same as using `SELECT DISTINCT` because the output rows may still contain duplicates. If any of the ungrouped columns contains NULL, it will be indistinguishable from the NULL used when that same column is grouped.

> [!NOTE]
> The construct `(a, b)` is normally recognized in expressions as a [row constructor](#sql-syntax-row-constructors). Within the `GROUP BY` clause, this does not apply at the top levels of expressions, and `(a, b)` is parsed as a list of expressions as described above. If for some reason you *need* a row constructor in a grouping expression, use `ROW(a, b)`.

### Window Function Processing

window function

order of execution

If the query contains any window functions (see [???](#tutorial-window), [???](#functions-window) and [???](#syntax-window-functions)), these functions are evaluated after any grouping, aggregation, and `HAVING` filtering is performed. That is, if the query uses any aggregates, `GROUP BY`, or `HAVING`, then the rows seen by the window functions are the group rows instead of the original table rows from `FROM`/`WHERE`.

When multiple window functions are used, all the window functions having equivalent `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses in their window definitions are guaranteed to see the same ordering of the input rows, even if the `ORDER BY` does not uniquely determine the ordering. However, no guarantees are made about the evaluation of functions having different `PARTITION BY` or `ORDER BY` specifications. (In such cases a sort step is typically required between the passes of window function evaluations, and the sort is not guaranteed to preserve ordering of rows that its `ORDER BY` sees as equivalent.)

Currently, window functions always require presorted data, and so the query output will be ordered according to one or another of the window functions' `PARTITION BY`/`ORDER BY` clauses. It is not recommended to rely on this, however. Use an explicit top-level `ORDER BY` clause if you want to be sure the results are sorted in a particular way.

## Select Lists

SELECT

select list

As shown in the previous section, the table expression in the `SELECT` command constructs an intermediate virtual table by possibly combining tables, views, eliminating rows, grouping, etc. This table is finally passed on to processing by the select list. The select list determines which *columns* of the intermediate table are actually output.

### Select-List Items

\*

The simplest kind of select list is `*` which emits all columns that the table expression produces. Otherwise, a select list is a comma-separated list of value expressions (as defined in [???](#sql-expressions)). For instance, it could be a list of column names:

    SELECT a, b, c FROM ...

The columns names `a`, `b`, and `c` are either the actual names of the columns of tables referenced in the `FROM` clause, or the aliases given to them as explained in [Table and Column Aliases](#queries-table-aliases). The name space available in the select list is the same as in the `WHERE` clause, unless grouping is used, in which case it is the same as in the `HAVING` clause.

If more than one table has a column of the same name, the table name must also be given, as in:

    SELECT tbl1.a, tbl2.a, tbl1.b FROM ...

When working with multiple tables, it can also be useful to ask for all the columns of a particular table:

    SELECT tbl1.*, tbl2.a FROM ...

See [???](#rowtypes-usage) for more about the \<table_name\>`.*` notation.

If an arbitrary value expression is used in the select list, it conceptually adds a new virtual column to the returned table. The value expression is evaluated once for each result row, with the row's values substituted for any column references. But the expressions in the select list do not have to reference any columns in the table expression of the `FROM` clause; they can be constant arithmetic expressions, for instance.

### Column Labels

alias

in the select list

The entries in the select list can be assigned names for subsequent processing, such as for use in an `ORDER BY` clause or for display by the client application. For example:

    SELECT a AS value, b + c AS sum FROM ...

If no output column name is specified using `AS`, the system assigns a default column name. For simple column references, this is the name of the referenced column. For function calls, this is the name of the function. For complex expressions, the system will generate a generic name.

The `AS` key word is usually optional, but in some cases where the desired column name matches a PostgreSQL key word, you must write `AS` or double-quote the column name in order to avoid ambiguity. ([???](#sql-keywords-appendix) shows which key words require `AS` to be used as a column label.) For example, `FROM` is one such key word, so this does not work:

    SELECT a from, b + c AS sum FROM ...

but either of these do:

    SELECT a AS from, b + c AS sum FROM ...
    SELECT a "from", b + c AS sum FROM ...

For greatest safety against possible future key word additions, it is recommended that you always either write `AS` or double-quote the output column name.

> [!NOTE]
> The naming of output columns here is different from that done in the `FROM` clause (see [Table and Column Aliases](#queries-table-aliases)). It is possible to rename the same column twice, but the name assigned in the select list is the one that will be passed on.

### `DISTINCT`

ALL

SELECT ALL

DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT

duplicates

After the select list has been processed, the result table can optionally be subject to the elimination of duplicate rows. The `DISTINCT` key word is written directly after `SELECT` to specify this: SELECT DISTINCT \<select_list\> ... (Instead of `DISTINCT` the key word `ALL` can be used to specify the default behavior of retaining all rows.)

null value

in DISTINCT

Obviously, two rows are considered distinct if they differ in at least one column value. Null values are considered equal in this comparison.

Alternatively, an arbitrary expression can determine what rows are to be considered distinct: SELECT DISTINCT ON (\<expression\> \[, \<expression\> ...\]) \<select_list\> ... Here \<expression\> is an arbitrary value expression that is evaluated for all rows. A set of rows for which all the expressions are equal are considered duplicates, and only the first row of the set is kept in the output. Note that the “first row” of a set is unpredictable unless the query is sorted on enough columns to guarantee a unique ordering of the rows arriving at the `DISTINCT` filter. (`DISTINCT ON` processing occurs after `ORDER BY` sorting.)

The `DISTINCT ON` clause is not part of the SQL standard and is sometimes considered bad style because of the potentially indeterminate nature of its results. With judicious use of `GROUP BY` and subqueries in `FROM`, this construct can be avoided, but it is often the most convenient alternative.

## Combining Queries (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)

UNION

INTERSECT

EXCEPT

set union

set intersection

set difference

set operation

The results of two queries can be combined using the set operations union, intersection, and difference. The syntax is \<query1\> UNION \[ALL\] \<query2\> \<query1\> INTERSECT \[ALL\] \<query2\> \<query1\> EXCEPT \[ALL\] \<query2\> where \<query1\> and \<query2\> are queries that can use any of the features discussed up to this point.

`UNION` effectively appends the result of \<query2\> to the result of \<query1\> (although there is no guarantee that this is the order in which the rows are actually returned). Furthermore, it eliminates duplicate rows from its result, in the same way as `DISTINCT`, unless `UNION ALL` is used.

`INTERSECT` returns all rows that are both in the result of \<query1\> and in the result of \<query2\>. Duplicate rows are eliminated unless `INTERSECT ALL` is used.

`EXCEPT` returns all rows that are in the result of \<query1\> but not in the result of \<query2\>. (This is sometimes called the difference between two queries.) Again, duplicates are eliminated unless `EXCEPT ALL` is used.

In order to calculate the union, intersection, or difference of two queries, the two queries must be “union compatible”, which means that they return the same number of columns and the corresponding columns have compatible data types, as described in [???](#typeconv-union-case).

Set operations can be combined, for example \<query1\> UNION \<query2\> EXCEPT \<query3\> which is equivalent to (\<query1\> UNION \<query2\>) EXCEPT \<query3\> As shown here, you can use parentheses to control the order of evaluation. Without parentheses, `UNION` and `EXCEPT` associate left-to-right, but `INTERSECT` binds more tightly than those two operators. Thus \<query1\> UNION \<query2\> INTERSECT \<query3\> means \<query1\> UNION (\<query2\> INTERSECT \<query3\>) You can also surround an individual \<query\> with parentheses. This is important if the \<query\> needs to use any of the clauses discussed in following sections, such as `LIMIT`. Without parentheses, you'll get a syntax error, or else the clause will be understood as applying to the output of the set operation rather than one of its inputs. For example, SELECT a FROM b UNION SELECT x FROM y LIMIT 10 is accepted, but it means (SELECT a FROM b UNION SELECT x FROM y) LIMIT 10 not SELECT a FROM b UNION (SELECT x FROM y LIMIT 10)

## Sorting Rows (`ORDER BY`)

sorting

ORDER BY

After a query has produced an output table (after the select list has been processed) it can optionally be sorted. If sorting is not chosen, the rows will be returned in an unspecified order. The actual order in that case will depend on the scan and join plan types and the order on disk, but it must not be relied on. A particular output ordering can only be guaranteed if the sort step is explicitly chosen.

The `ORDER BY` clause specifies the sort order: SELECT \<select_list\> FROM \<table_expression\> ORDER BY \<sort_expression1\> \[ASC \| DESC\] \[NULLS { FIRST \| LAST }\] \[, \<sort_expression2\> \[ASC \| DESC\] \[NULLS { FIRST \| LAST }\] ...\] The sort expression(s) can be any expression that would be valid in the query's select list. An example is:

    SELECT a, b FROM table1 ORDER BY a + b, c;

When more than one expression is specified, the later values are used to sort rows that are equal according to the earlier values. Each expression can be followed by an optional `ASC` or `DESC` keyword to set the sort direction to ascending or descending. `ASC` order is the default. Ascending order puts smaller values first, where “smaller” is defined in terms of the `<` operator. Similarly, descending order is determined with the `>` operator. [^1]

The `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST` options can be used to determine whether nulls appear before or after non-null values in the sort ordering. By default, null values sort as if larger than any non-null value; that is, `NULLS FIRST` is the default for `DESC` order, and `NULLS LAST` otherwise.

Note that the ordering options are considered independently for each sort column. For example `ORDER BY x, y DESC` means `ORDER BY x ASC, y DESC`, which is not the same as `ORDER BY x DESC, y DESC`.

A \<sort_expression\> can also be the column label or number of an output column, as in:

    SELECT a + b AS sum, c FROM table1 ORDER BY sum;
    SELECT a, max(b) FROM table1 GROUP BY a ORDER BY 1;

both of which sort by the first output column. Note that an output column name has to stand alone, that is, it cannot be used in an expression for example, this is *not* correct:

    SELECT a + b AS sum, c FROM table1 ORDER BY sum + c;          -- wrong

This restriction is made to reduce ambiguity. There is still ambiguity if an `ORDER BY` item is a simple name that could match either an output column name or a column from the table expression. The output column is used in such cases. This would only cause confusion if you use `AS` to rename an output column to match some other table column's name.

`ORDER BY` can be applied to the result of a `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT` combination, but in this case it is only permitted to sort by output column names or numbers, not by expressions.

## `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`

LIMIT

OFFSET

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` allow you to retrieve just a portion of the rows that are generated by the rest of the query: SELECT \<select_list\> FROM \<table_expression\> \[ORDER BY ...\] \[LIMIT { \<count\> \| ALL }\] \[OFFSET \<start\>\]

If a limit count is given, no more than that many rows will be returned (but possibly fewer, if the query itself yields fewer rows). `LIMIT ALL` is the same as omitting the `LIMIT` clause, as is `LIMIT` with a NULL argument.

`OFFSET` says to skip that many rows before beginning to return rows. `OFFSET 0` is the same as omitting the `OFFSET` clause, as is `OFFSET` with a NULL argument.

If both `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` appear, then `OFFSET` rows are skipped before starting to count the `LIMIT` rows that are returned.

When using `LIMIT`, it is important to use an `ORDER BY` clause that constrains the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows. You might be asking for the tenth through twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering? The ordering is unknown, unless you specified `ORDER BY`.

The query optimizer takes `LIMIT` into account when generating query plans, so you are very likely to get different plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you give for `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`. Thus, using different `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` values to select different subsets of a query result *will give inconsistent results* unless you enforce a predictable result ordering with `ORDER BY`. This is not a bug; it is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not promise to deliver the results of a query in any particular order unless `ORDER BY` is used to constrain the order.

The rows skipped by an `OFFSET` clause still have to be computed inside the server; therefore a large `OFFSET` might be inefficient.

## `VALUES` Lists

VALUES

`VALUES` provides a way to generate a “constant table” that can be used in a query without having to actually create and populate a table on-disk. The syntax is VALUES ( \<expression\> \[, ...\] ) \[, ...\] Each parenthesized list of expressions generates a row in the table. The lists must all have the same number of elements (i.e., the number of columns in the table), and corresponding entries in each list must have compatible data types. The actual data type assigned to each column of the result is determined using the same rules as for `UNION` (see [???](#typeconv-union-case)).

As an example:

    VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three');

will return a table of two columns and three rows. It's effectively equivalent to:

    SELECT 1 AS column1, 'one' AS column2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 'two'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 'three';

By default, PostgreSQL assigns the names `column1`, `column2`, etc. to the columns of a `VALUES` table. The column names are not specified by the SQL standard and different database systems do it differently, so it's usually better to override the default names with a table alias list, like this:

    => SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')) AS t (num,letter);
     num | letter
    -----+--------
       1 | one
       2 | two
       3 | three
    (3 rows)

Syntactically, `VALUES` followed by expression lists is treated as equivalent to: SELECT \<select_list\> FROM \<table_expression\> and can appear anywhere a `SELECT` can. For example, you can use it as part of a `UNION`, or attach a \<sort_specification\> (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and/or `OFFSET`) to it. `VALUES` is most commonly used as the data source in an `INSERT` command, and next most commonly as a subquery.

For more information see [???](#sql-values).

## `WITH` Queries (Common Table Expressions)

WITH

in SELECT

common table expression

WITH

`WITH` provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. These statements, which are often referred to as Common Table Expressions or CTEs, can be thought of as defining temporary tables that exist just for one query. Each auxiliary statement in a `WITH` clause can be a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`; and the `WITH` clause itself is attached to a primary statement that can also be a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`.

### `SELECT` in `WITH`

The basic value of `SELECT` in `WITH` is to break down complicated queries into simpler parts. An example is:

    WITH regional_sales AS (
        SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY region
    ), top_regions AS (
        SELECT region
        FROM regional_sales
        WHERE total_sales > (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
    )
    SELECT region,
           product,
           SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
           SUM(amount) AS product_sales
    FROM orders
    WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
    GROUP BY region, product;

which displays per-product sales totals in only the top sales regions. The `WITH` clause defines two auxiliary statements named regional_sales and top_regions, where the output of regional_sales is used in top_regions and the output of top_regions is used in the primary `SELECT` query. This example could have been written without `WITH`, but we'd have needed two levels of nested sub-`SELECT`s. It's a bit easier to follow this way.

### Recursive Queries

<span class="indexterm"></span> The optional `RECURSIVE` modifier changes `WITH` from a mere syntactic convenience into a feature that accomplishes things not otherwise possible in standard SQL. Using `RECURSIVE`, a `WITH` query can refer to its own output. A very simple example is this query to sum the integers from 1 through 100:

    WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
        VALUES (1)
      UNION ALL
        SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n < 100
    )
    SELECT sum(n) FROM t;

The general form of a recursive `WITH` query is always a non-recursive term, then `UNION` (or `UNION ALL`), then a recursive term, where only the recursive term can contain a reference to the query's own output. Such a query is executed as follows:

1.  Evaluate the non-recursive term. For `UNION` (but not `UNION ALL`), discard duplicate rows. Include all remaining rows in the result of the recursive query, and also place them in a temporary working table.

2.  So long as the working table is not empty, repeat these steps:

    1.  Evaluate the recursive term, substituting the current contents of the working table for the recursive self-reference. For `UNION` (but not `UNION ALL`), discard duplicate rows and rows that duplicate any previous result row. Include all remaining rows in the result of the recursive query, and also place them in a temporary intermediate table.

    2.  Replace the contents of the working table with the contents of the intermediate table, then empty the intermediate table.

> [!NOTE]
> While `RECURSIVE` allows queries to be specified recursively, internally such queries are evaluated iteratively.

In the example above, the working table has just a single row in each step, and it takes on the values from 1 through 100 in successive steps. In the 100th step, there is no output because of the `WHERE` clause, and so the query terminates.

Recursive queries are typically used to deal with hierarchical or tree-structured data. A useful example is this query to find all the direct and indirect sub-parts of a product, given only a table that shows immediate inclusions:

    WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part, quantity) AS (
        SELECT sub_part, part, quantity FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
      UNION ALL
        SELECT p.sub_part, p.part, p.quantity * pr.quantity
        FROM included_parts pr, parts p
        WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
    )
    SELECT sub_part, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
    FROM included_parts
    GROUP BY sub_part

#### Search Order

When computing a tree traversal using a recursive query, you might want to order the results in either depth-first or breadth-first order. This can be done by computing an ordering column alongside the other data columns and using that to sort the results at the end. Note that this does not actually control in which order the query evaluation visits the rows; that is as always in SQL implementation-dependent. This approach merely provides a convenient way to order the results afterwards.

To create a depth-first order, we compute for each result row an array of rows that we have visited so far. For example, consider the following query that searches a table tree using a link field:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_tree;

To add depth-first ordering information, you can write this:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data, path) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, ARRAY[t.id]
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, path || t.id
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY path;

In the general case where more than one field needs to be used to identify a row, use an array of rows. For example, if we needed to track fields f1 and f2:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data, path) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, ARRAY[ROW(t.f1, t.f2)]
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, path || ROW(t.f1, t.f2)
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY path;

> [!TIP]
> Omit the `ROW()` syntax in the common case where only one field needs to be tracked. This allows a simple array rather than a composite-type array to be used, gaining efficiency.

To create a breadth-first order, you can add a column that tracks the depth of the search, for example:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, 0
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, depth + 1
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY depth;

To get a stable sort, add data columns as secondary sorting columns.

> [!TIP]
> The recursive query evaluation algorithm produces its output in breadth-first search order. However, this is an implementation detail and it is perhaps unsound to rely on it. The order of the rows within each level is certainly undefined, so some explicit ordering might be desired in any case.

There is built-in syntax to compute a depth- or breadth-first sort column. For example:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    ) SEARCH DEPTH FIRST BY id SET ordercol
    SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY ordercol;

    WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data) AS (
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t
      UNION ALL
        SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data
        FROM tree t, search_tree st
        WHERE t.id = st.link
    ) SEARCH BREADTH FIRST BY id SET ordercol
    SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY ordercol;

This syntax is internally expanded to something similar to the above hand-written forms. The `SEARCH` clause specifies whether depth- or breadth first search is wanted, the list of columns to track for sorting, and a column name that will contain the result data that can be used for sorting. That column will implicitly be added to the output rows of the CTE.

#### Cycle Detection

When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuples, or else the query will loop indefinitely. Sometimes, using `UNION` instead of `UNION ALL` can accomplish this by discarding rows that duplicate previous output rows. However, often a cycle does not involve output rows that are completely duplicate: it may be necessary to check just one or a few fields to see if the same point has been reached before. The standard method for handling such situations is to compute an array of the already-visited values. For example, consider again the following query that searches a table graph using a link field:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 0
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_graph;

This query will loop if the link relationships contain cycles. Because we require a “depth” output, just changing `UNION ALL` to `UNION` would not eliminate the looping. Instead we need to recognize whether we have reached the same row again while following a particular path of links. We add two columns is_cycle and path to the loop-prone query:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, is_cycle, path) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 0,
          false,
          ARRAY[g.id]
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          g.id = ANY(path),
          path || g.id
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT is_cycle
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_graph;

Aside from preventing cycles, the array value is often useful in its own right as representing the “path” taken to reach any particular row.

In the general case where more than one field needs to be checked to recognize a cycle, use an array of rows. For example, if we needed to compare fields f1 and f2:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, is_cycle, path) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 0,
          false,
          ARRAY[ROW(g.f1, g.f2)]
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          ROW(g.f1, g.f2) = ANY(path),
          path || ROW(g.f1, g.f2)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT is_cycle
    )
    SELECT * FROM search_graph;

> [!TIP]
> Omit the `ROW()` syntax in the common case where only one field needs to be checked to recognize a cycle. This allows a simple array rather than a composite-type array to be used, gaining efficiency.

There is built-in syntax to simplify cycle detection. The above query can also be written like this:

    WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link
    ) CYCLE id SET is_cycle USING path
    SELECT * FROM search_graph;

and it will be internally rewritten to the above form. The `CYCLE` clause specifies first the list of columns to track for cycle detection, then a column name that will show whether a cycle has been detected, and finally the name of another column that will track the path. The cycle and path columns will implicitly be added to the output rows of the CTE.

> [!TIP]
> The cycle path column is computed in the same way as the depth-first ordering column show in the previous section. A query can have both a `SEARCH` and a `CYCLE` clause, but a depth-first search specification and a cycle detection specification would create redundant computations, so it's more efficient to just use the `CYCLE` clause and order by the path column. If breadth-first ordering is wanted, then specifying both `SEARCH` and `CYCLE` can be useful.

A helpful trick for testing queries when you are not certain if they might loop is to place a `LIMIT` in the parent query. For example, this query would loop forever without the `LIMIT`:

    WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
        SELECT 1
      UNION ALL
        SELECT n+1 FROM t
    )
    SELECT n FROM t LIMIT 100;

This works because PostgreSQL's implementation evaluates only as many rows of a `WITH` query as are actually fetched by the parent query. Using this trick in production is not recommended, because other systems might work differently. Also, it usually won't work if you make the outer query sort the recursive query's results or join them to some other table, because in such cases the outer query will usually try to fetch all of the `WITH` query's output anyway.

### Common Table Expression Materialization

A useful property of `WITH` queries is that they are normally evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling `WITH` queries. Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be placed within a `WITH` query to avoid redundant work. Another possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of functions with side-effects. However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is not able to push restrictions from the parent query down into a multiply-referenced `WITH` query, since that might affect all uses of the `WITH` query's output when it should affect only one. The multiply-referenced `WITH` query will be evaluated as written, without suppression of rows that the parent query might discard afterwards. (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of rows.)

However, if a `WITH` query is non-recursive and side-effect-free (that is, it is a `SELECT` containing no volatile functions) then it can be folded into the parent query, allowing joint optimization of the two query levels. By default, this happens if the parent query references the `WITH` query just once, but not if it references the `WITH` query more than once. You can override that decision by specifying `MATERIALIZED` to force separate calculation of the `WITH` query, or by specifying `NOT MATERIALIZED` to force it to be merged into the parent query. The latter choice risks duplicate computation of the `WITH` query, but it can still give a net savings if each usage of the `WITH` query needs only a small part of the `WITH` query's full output.

A simple example of these rules is

    WITH w AS (
        SELECT * FROM big_table
    )
    SELECT * FROM w WHERE key = 123;

This `WITH` query will be folded, producing the same execution plan as

    SELECT * FROM big_table WHERE key = 123;

In particular, if there's an index on key, it will probably be used to fetch just the rows having `key = 123`. On the other hand, in

    WITH w AS (
        SELECT * FROM big_table
    )
    SELECT * FROM w AS w1 JOIN w AS w2 ON w1.key = w2.ref
    WHERE w2.key = 123;

the `WITH` query will be materialized, producing a temporary copy of big_table that is then joined with itself without benefit of any index. This query will be executed much more efficiently if written as

    WITH w AS NOT MATERIALIZED (
        SELECT * FROM big_table
    )
    SELECT * FROM w AS w1 JOIN w AS w2 ON w1.key = w2.ref
    WHERE w2.key = 123;

so that the parent query's restrictions can be applied directly to scans of big_table.

An example where `NOT MATERIALIZED` could be undesirable is

    WITH w AS (
        SELECT key, very_expensive_function(val) as f FROM some_table
    )
    SELECT * FROM w AS w1 JOIN w AS w2 ON w1.f = w2.f;

Here, materialization of the `WITH` query ensures that `very_expensive_function` is evaluated only once per table row, not twice.

The examples above only show `WITH` being used with `SELECT`, but it can be attached in the same way to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`. In each case it effectively provides temporary table(s) that can be referred to in the main command.

### Data-Modifying Statements in `WITH`

You can use data-modifying statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`) in `WITH`. This allows you to perform several different operations in the same query. An example is:

    WITH moved_rows AS (
        DELETE FROM products
        WHERE
            "date" >= '2010-10-01' AND
            "date" < '2010-11-01'
        RETURNING *
    )
    INSERT INTO products_log
    SELECT * FROM moved_rows;

This query effectively moves rows from products to products_log. The `DELETE` in `WITH` deletes the specified rows from products, returning their contents by means of its `RETURNING` clause; and then the primary query reads that output and inserts it into products_log.

A fine point of the above example is that the `WITH` clause is attached to the `INSERT`, not the sub-`SELECT` within the `INSERT`. This is necessary because data-modifying statements are only allowed in `WITH` clauses that are attached to the top-level statement. However, normal `WITH` visibility rules apply, so it is possible to refer to the `WITH` statement's output from the sub-`SELECT`.

Data-modifying statements in `WITH` usually have `RETURNING` clauses (see [???](#dml-returning)), as shown in the example above. It is the output of the `RETURNING` clause, *not* the target table of the data-modifying statement, that forms the temporary table that can be referred to by the rest of the query. If a data-modifying statement in `WITH` lacks a `RETURNING` clause, then it forms no temporary table and cannot be referred to in the rest of the query. Such a statement will be executed nonetheless. A not-particularly-useful example is:

    WITH t AS (
        DELETE FROM foo
    )
    DELETE FROM bar;

This example would remove all rows from tables foo and bar. The number of affected rows reported to the client would only include rows removed from bar.

Recursive self-references in data-modifying statements are not allowed. In some cases it is possible to work around this limitation by referring to the output of a recursive `WITH`, for example:

    WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part) AS (
        SELECT sub_part, part FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
      UNION ALL
        SELECT p.sub_part, p.part
        FROM included_parts pr, parts p
        WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
    )
    DELETE FROM parts
      WHERE part IN (SELECT part FROM included_parts);

This query would remove all direct and indirect subparts of a product.

Data-modifying statements in `WITH` are executed exactly once, and always to completion, independently of whether the primary query reads all (or indeed any) of their output. Notice that this is different from the rule for `SELECT` in `WITH`: as stated in the previous section, execution of a `SELECT` is carried only as far as the primary query demands its output.

The sub-statements in `WITH` are executed concurrently with each other and with the main query. Therefore, when using data-modifying statements in `WITH`, the order in which the specified updates actually happen is unpredictable. All the statements are executed with the same snapshot (see [???](#mvcc)), so they cannot “see” one another's effects on the target tables. This alleviates the effects of the unpredictability of the actual order of row updates, and means that `RETURNING` data is the only way to communicate changes between different `WITH` sub-statements and the main query. An example of this is that in

    WITH t AS (
        UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.05
        RETURNING *
    )
    SELECT * FROM products;

the outer `SELECT` would return the original prices before the action of the `UPDATE`, while in

    WITH t AS (
        UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.05
        RETURNING *
    )
    SELECT * FROM t;

the outer `SELECT` would return the updated data.

Trying to update the same row twice in a single statement is not supported. Only one of the modifications takes place, but it is not easy (and sometimes not possible) to reliably predict which one. This also applies to deleting a row that was already updated in the same statement: only the update is performed. Therefore you should generally avoid trying to modify a single row twice in a single statement. In particular avoid writing `WITH` sub-statements that could affect the same rows changed by the main statement or a sibling sub-statement. The effects of such a statement will not be predictable.

At present, any table used as the target of a data-modifying statement in `WITH` must not have a conditional rule, nor an `ALSO` rule, nor an `INSTEAD` rule that expands to multiple statements.

[^1]: Actually, PostgreSQL uses the default B-tree operator class for the expression's data type to determine the sort ordering for `ASC` and `DESC`. Conventionally, data types will be set up so that the `<` and `>` operators correspond to this sort ordering, but a user-defined data type's designer could choose to do something different.
