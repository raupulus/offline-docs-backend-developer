## PL/Tcl Tcl Procedural Language

PL/Tcl

Tcl

PL/Tcl is a loadable procedural language for the PostgreSQL database system that enables the [ Tcl language](https://www.tcl.tk/) to be used to write PostgreSQL functions and procedures.

## Overview

PL/Tcl offers most of the capabilities a function writer has in the C language, with a few restrictions, and with the addition of the powerful string processing libraries that are available for Tcl.

One compelling *good* restriction is that everything is executed from within the safety of the context of a Tcl interpreter. In addition to the limited command set of safe Tcl, only a few commands are available to access the database via SPI and to raise messages via `elog()`. PL/Tcl provides no way to access internals of the database server or to gain OS-level access under the permissions of the PostgreSQL server process, as a C function can do. Thus, unprivileged database users can be trusted to use this language; it does not give them unlimited authority.

The other notable implementation restriction is that Tcl functions cannot be used to create input/output functions for new data types.

Sometimes it is desirable to write Tcl functions that are not restricted to safe Tcl. For example, one might want a Tcl function that sends email. To handle these cases, there is a variant of PL/Tcl called `PL/TclU` (for untrusted Tcl). This is exactly the same language except that a full Tcl interpreter is used. *If PL/TclU is used, it must be installed as an untrusted procedural language* so that only database superusers can create functions in it. The writer of a PL/TclU function must take care that the function cannot be used to do anything unwanted, since it will be able to do anything that could be done by a user logged in as the database administrator.

The shared object code for the PL/Tcl and PL/TclU call handlers is automatically built and installed in the PostgreSQL library directory if Tcl support is specified in the configuration step of the installation procedure. To install PL/Tcl and/or PL/TclU in a particular database, use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, for example `CREATE EXTENSION pltcl` or `CREATE EXTENSION pltclu`.

## PL/Tcl Functions and Arguments

To create a function in the PL/Tcl language, use the standard [???](#sql-createfunction) syntax:

    CREATE FUNCTION funcname (argument-types) RETURNS return-type AS $$
        # PL/Tcl function body
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

PL/TclU is the same, except that the language has to be specified as `pltclu`.

The body of the function is simply a piece of Tcl script. When the function is called, the argument values are passed to the Tcl script as variables named `1` ... `n`. The result is returned from the Tcl code in the usual way, with a `return` statement. In a procedure, the return value from the Tcl code is ignored.

For example, a function returning the greater of two integer values could be defined as:

    CREATE FUNCTION tcl_max(integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
        if {$1 > $2} {return $1}
        return $2
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl STRICT;

Note the clause `STRICT`, which saves us from having to think about null input values: if a null value is passed, the function will not be called at all, but will just return a null result automatically.

In a nonstrict function, if the actual value of an argument is null, the corresponding `$n` variable will be set to an empty string. To detect whether a particular argument is null, use the function `argisnull`. For example, suppose that we wanted `tcl_max` with one null and one nonnull argument to return the nonnull argument, rather than null:

    CREATE FUNCTION tcl_max(integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
        if {[argisnull 1]} {
            if {[argisnull 2]} { return_null }
            return $2
        }
        if {[argisnull 2]} { return $1 }
        if {$1 > $2} {return $1}
        return $2
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

As shown above, to return a null value from a PL/Tcl function, execute `return_null`. This can be done whether the function is strict or not.

Composite-type arguments are passed to the function as Tcl arrays. The element names of the array are the attribute names of the composite type. If an attribute in the passed row has the null value, it will not appear in the array. Here is an example:

    CREATE TABLE employee (
        name text,
        salary integer,
        age integer
    );

    CREATE FUNCTION overpaid(employee) RETURNS boolean AS $$
        if {200000.0 < $1(salary)} {
            return "t"
        }
        if {$1(age) < 30 && 100000.0 < $1(salary)} {
            return "t"
        }
        return "f"
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

PL/Tcl functions can return composite-type results, too. To do this, the Tcl code must return a list of column name/value pairs matching the expected result type. Any column names omitted from the list are returned as nulls, and an error is raised if there are unexpected column names. Here is an example:

    CREATE FUNCTION square_cube(in int, out squared int, out cubed int) AS $$
        return [list squared [expr {$1 * $1}] cubed [expr {$1 * $1 * $1}]]
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

Output arguments of procedures are returned in the same way, for example:

    CREATE PROCEDURE tcl_triple(INOUT a integer, INOUT b integer) AS $$
        return [list a [expr {$1 * 3}] b [expr {$2 * 3}]]
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

    CALL tcl_triple(5, 10);

> [!TIP]
> The result list can be made from an array representation of the desired tuple with the `array get` Tcl command. For example:
>
>     CREATE FUNCTION raise_pay(employee, delta int) RETURNS employee AS $$
>         set 1(salary) [expr {$1(salary) + $2}]
>         return [array get 1]
>     $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

PL/Tcl functions can return sets. To do this, the Tcl code should call `return_next` once per row to be returned, passing either the appropriate value when returning a scalar type, or a list of column name/value pairs when returning a composite type. Here is an example returning a scalar type:

    CREATE FUNCTION sequence(int, int) RETURNS SETOF int AS $$
        for {set i $1} {$i < $2} {incr i} {
            return_next $i
        }
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

and here is one returning a composite type:

    CREATE FUNCTION table_of_squares(int, int) RETURNS TABLE (x int, x2 int) AS $$
        for {set i $1} {$i < $2} {incr i} {
            return_next [list x $i x2 [expr {$i * $i}]]
        }
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

## Data Values in PL/Tcl

The argument values supplied to a PL/Tcl function's code are simply the input arguments converted to text form (just as if they had been displayed by a `SELECT` statement). Conversely, the `return` and `return_next` commands will accept any string that is acceptable input format for the function's declared result type, or for the specified column of a composite result type.

## Global Data in PL/Tcl

global data

in PL/Tcl

Sometimes it is useful to have some global data that is held between two calls to a function or is shared between different functions. This is easily done in PL/Tcl, but there are some restrictions that must be understood.

For security reasons, PL/Tcl executes functions called by any one SQL role in a separate Tcl interpreter for that role. This prevents accidental or malicious interference by one user with the behavior of another user's PL/Tcl functions. Each such interpreter will have its own values for any “global” Tcl variables. Thus, two PL/Tcl functions will share the same global variables if and only if they are executed by the same SQL role. In an application wherein a single session executes code under multiple SQL roles (via `SECURITY DEFINER` functions, use of `SET ROLE`, etc.) you may need to take explicit steps to ensure that PL/Tcl functions can share data. To do that, make sure that functions that should communicate are owned by the same user, and mark them `SECURITY DEFINER`. You must of course take care that such functions can't be used to do anything unintended.

All PL/TclU functions used in a session execute in the same Tcl interpreter, which of course is distinct from the interpreter(s) used for PL/Tcl functions. So global data is automatically shared between PL/TclU functions. This is not considered a security risk because all PL/TclU functions execute at the same trust level, namely that of a database superuser.

To help protect PL/Tcl functions from unintentionally interfering with each other, a global array is made available to each function via the `upvar` command. The global name of this variable is the function's internal name, and the local name is `GD`. It is recommended that `GD` be used for persistent private data of a function. Use regular Tcl global variables only for values that you specifically intend to be shared among multiple functions. (Note that the `GD` arrays are only global within a particular interpreter, so they do not bypass the security restrictions mentioned above.)

An example of using `GD` appears in the `spi_execp` example below.

## Database Access from PL/Tcl

In this section, we follow the usual Tcl convention of using question marks, rather than brackets, to indicate an optional element in a syntax synopsis. The following commands are available to access the database from the body of a PL/Tcl function:

`spi_exec -count n -array name command loop-body`  
Executes an SQL command given as a string. An error in the command causes an error to be raised. Otherwise, the return value of `spi_exec` is the number of rows processed (selected, inserted, updated, or deleted) by the command, or zero if the command is a utility statement. In addition, if the command is a `SELECT` statement, the values of the selected columns are placed in Tcl variables as described below.

The optional `-count` value tells `spi_exec` to stop once \<n\> rows have been retrieved, much as if the query included a `LIMIT` clause. If \<n\> is zero, the query is run to completion, the same as when `-count` is omitted.

If the command is a `SELECT` statement, the values of the result columns are placed into Tcl variables named after the columns. If the `-array` option is given, the column values are instead stored into elements of the named associative array, with the column names used as array indexes. In addition, the current row number within the result (counting from zero) is stored into the array element named “`.tupno`”, unless that name is in use as a column name in the result.

If the command is a `SELECT` statement and no \<loop-body\> script is given, then only the first row of results are stored into Tcl variables or array elements; remaining rows, if any, are ignored. No storing occurs if the query returns no rows. (This case can be detected by checking the result of `spi_exec`.) For example:

    spi_exec "SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM pg_proc"

will set the Tcl variable `$cnt` to the number of rows in the pg_proc system catalog.

If the optional \<loop-body\> argument is given, it is a piece of Tcl script that is executed once for each row in the query result. (\<loop-body\> is ignored if the given command is not a `SELECT`.) The values of the current row's columns are stored into Tcl variables or array elements before each iteration. For example:

    spi_exec -array C "SELECT * FROM pg_class" {
        elog DEBUG "have table $C(relname)"
    }

will print a log message for every row of `pg_class`. This feature works similarly to other Tcl looping constructs; in particular `continue` and `break` work in the usual way inside the loop body.

If a column of a query result is null, the target variable for it is “unset” rather than being set.

`spi_prepare` \<query\> \<typelist\>  
Prepares and saves a query plan for later execution. The saved plan will be retained for the life of the current session.<span class="indexterm"></span>

The query can use parameters, that is, placeholders for values to be supplied whenever the plan is actually executed. In the query string, refer to parameters by the symbols `$1` ... `$n`. If the query uses parameters, the names of the parameter types must be given as a Tcl list. (Write an empty list for \<typelist\> if no parameters are used.)

The return value from `spi_prepare` is a query ID to be used in subsequent calls to `spi_execp`. See `spi_execp` for an example.

`spi_execp -count n -array name -nulls string queryid value-list loop-body`  
Executes a query previously prepared with `spi_prepare`. \<queryid\> is the ID returned by `spi_prepare`. If the query references parameters, a \<value-list\> must be supplied. This is a Tcl list of actual values for the parameters. The list must be the same length as the parameter type list previously given to `spi_prepare`. Omit \<value-list\> if the query has no parameters.

The optional value for `-nulls` is a string of spaces and `'n'` characters telling `spi_execp` which of the parameters are null values. If given, it must have exactly the same length as the \<value-list\>. If it is not given, all the parameter values are nonnull.

Except for the way in which the query and its parameters are specified, `spi_execp` works just like `spi_exec`. The `-count`, `-array`, and \<loop-body\> options are the same, and so is the result value.

Here's an example of a PL/Tcl function using a prepared plan:

    CREATE FUNCTION t1_count(integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
        if {![ info exists GD(plan) ]} {
            # prepare the saved plan on the first call
            set GD(plan) [ spi_prepare \
                    "SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM t1 WHERE num >= \$1 AND num <= \$2" \
                    [ list int4 int4 ] ]
        }
        spi_execp -count 1 $GD(plan) [ list $1 $2 ]
        return $cnt
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

We need backslashes inside the query string given to `spi_prepare` to ensure that the `$n` markers will be passed through to `spi_prepare` as-is, and not replaced by Tcl variable substitution.

`subtransaction` \<command\>  
The Tcl script contained in \<command\> is executed within an SQL subtransaction. If the script returns an error, that entire subtransaction is rolled back before returning the error out to the surrounding Tcl code. See [Explicit Subtransactions in PL/Tcl](#pltcl-subtransactions) for more details and an example.

`quote` \<string\>  
Doubles all occurrences of single quote and backslash characters in the given string. This can be used to safely quote strings that are to be inserted into SQL commands given to `spi_exec` or `spi_prepare`. For example, think about an SQL command string like:

    "SELECT '$val' AS ret"

where the Tcl variable `val` actually contains `doesn't`. This would result in the final command string:

    SELECT 'doesn't' AS ret

which would cause a parse error during `spi_exec` or `spi_prepare`. To work properly, the submitted command should contain:

    SELECT 'doesn''t' AS ret

which can be formed in PL/Tcl using:

    "SELECT '[ quote $val ]' AS ret"

One advantage of `spi_execp` is that you don't have to quote parameter values like this, since the parameters are never parsed as part of an SQL command string.

`elog` \<level\> \<msg\> <span class="indexterm"></span>  
Emits a log or error message. Possible levels are `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`. `ERROR` raises an error condition; if this is not trapped by the surrounding Tcl code, the error propagates out to the calling query, causing the current transaction or subtransaction to be aborted. This is effectively the same as the Tcl `error` command. `FATAL` aborts the transaction and causes the current session to shut down. (There is probably no good reason to use this error level in PL/Tcl functions, but it's provided for completeness.) The other levels only generate messages of different priority levels. Whether messages of a particular priority are reported to the client, written to the server log, or both is controlled by the [???](#guc-log-min-messages) and [???](#guc-client-min-messages) configuration variables. See [???](#runtime-config) and [Error Handling in PL/Tcl](#pltcl-error-handling) for more information.

## Trigger Functions in PL/Tcl

trigger

in PL/Tcl

Trigger functions can be written in PL/Tcl. PostgreSQL requires that a function that is to be called as a trigger must be declared as a function with no arguments and a return type of `trigger`.

The information from the trigger manager is passed to the function body in the following variables:

`$TG_name`  
The name of the trigger from the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement.

`$TG_relid`  
The object ID of the table that caused the trigger function to be invoked.

`$TG_table_name`  
The name of the table that caused the trigger function to be invoked.

`$TG_table_schema`  
The schema of the table that caused the trigger function to be invoked.

`$TG_relatts`  
A Tcl list of the table column names, prefixed with an empty list element. So looking up a column name in the list with Tcl's `lsearch` command returns the element's number starting with 1 for the first column, the same way the columns are customarily numbered in PostgreSQL. (Empty list elements also appear in the positions of columns that have been dropped, so that the attribute numbering is correct for columns to their right.)

`$TG_when`  
The string `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, or `INSTEAD OF`, depending on the type of trigger event.

`$TG_level`  
The string `ROW` or `STATEMENT` depending on the type of trigger event.

`$TG_op`  
The string `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` depending on the type of trigger event.

`$NEW`  
An associative array containing the values of the new table row for `INSERT` or `UPDATE` actions, or empty for `DELETE`. The array is indexed by column name. Columns that are null will not appear in the array. This is not set for statement-level triggers.

`$OLD`  
An associative array containing the values of the old table row for `UPDATE` or `DELETE` actions, or empty for `INSERT`. The array is indexed by column name. Columns that are null will not appear in the array. This is not set for statement-level triggers.

`$args`  
A Tcl list of the arguments to the function as given in the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement. These arguments are also accessible as `$1` ... `$n` in the function body.

The return value from a trigger function can be one of the strings `OK` or `SKIP`, or a list of column name/value pairs. If the return value is `OK`, the operation (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`) that fired the trigger will proceed normally. `SKIP` tells the trigger manager to silently suppress the operation for this row. If a list is returned, it tells PL/Tcl to return a modified row to the trigger manager; the contents of the modified row are specified by the column names and values in the list. Any columns not mentioned in the list are set to null. Returning a modified row is only meaningful for row-level `BEFORE` `INSERT` or `UPDATE` triggers, for which the modified row will be inserted instead of the one given in `$NEW`; or for row-level `INSTEAD OF` `INSERT` or `UPDATE` triggers where the returned row is used as the source data for `INSERT RETURNING` or `UPDATE RETURNING` clauses. In row-level `BEFORE` `DELETE` or `INSTEAD OF` `DELETE` triggers, returning a modified row has the same effect as returning `OK`, that is the operation proceeds. The trigger return value is ignored for all other types of triggers.

> [!TIP]
> The result list can be made from an array representation of the modified tuple with the `array get` Tcl command.

Here's a little example trigger function that forces an integer value in a table to keep track of the number of updates that are performed on the row. For new rows inserted, the value is initialized to 0 and then incremented on every update operation.

    CREATE FUNCTION trigfunc_modcount() RETURNS trigger AS $$
        switch $TG_op {
            INSERT {
                set NEW($1) 0
            }
            UPDATE {
                set NEW($1) $OLD($1)
                incr NEW($1)
            }
            default {
                return OK
            }
        }
        return [array get NEW]
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

    CREATE TABLE mytab (num integer, description text, modcnt integer);

    CREATE TRIGGER trig_mytab_modcount BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON mytab
        FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION trigfunc_modcount('modcnt');

Notice that the trigger function itself does not know the column name; that's supplied from the trigger arguments. This lets the trigger function be reused with different tables.

## Event Trigger Functions in PL/Tcl

event trigger

in PL/Tcl

Event trigger functions can be written in PL/Tcl. PostgreSQL requires that a function that is to be called as an event trigger must be declared as a function with no arguments and a return type of `event_trigger`.

The information from the trigger manager is passed to the function body in the following variables:

`$TG_event`  
The name of the event the trigger is fired for.

`$TG_tag`  
The command tag for which the trigger is fired.

The return value of the trigger function is ignored.

Here's a little example event trigger function that simply raises a `NOTICE` message each time a supported command is executed:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tclsnitch() RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
      elog NOTICE "tclsnitch: $TG_event $TG_tag"
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

    CREATE EVENT TRIGGER tcl_a_snitch ON ddl_command_start EXECUTE FUNCTION tclsnitch();

## Error Handling in PL/Tcl

exceptions

in PL/Tcl

Tcl code within or called from a PL/Tcl function can raise an error, either by executing some invalid operation or by generating an error using the Tcl `error` command or PL/Tcl's `elog` command. Such errors can be caught within Tcl using the Tcl `catch` command. If an error is not caught but is allowed to propagate out to the top level of execution of the PL/Tcl function, it is reported as an SQL error in the function's calling query.

Conversely, SQL errors that occur within PL/Tcl's `spi_exec`, `spi_prepare`, and `spi_execp` commands are reported as Tcl errors, so they are catchable by Tcl's `catch` command. (Each of these PL/Tcl commands runs its SQL operation in a subtransaction, which is rolled back on error, so that any partially-completed operation is automatically cleaned up.) Again, if an error propagates out to the top level without being caught, it turns back into an SQL error.

Tcl provides an `errorCode` variable that can represent additional information about an error in a form that is easy for Tcl programs to interpret. The contents are in Tcl list format, and the first word identifies the subsystem or library reporting the error; beyond that the contents are left to the individual subsystem or library. For database errors reported by PL/Tcl commands, the first word is `POSTGRES`, the second word is the PostgreSQL version number, and additional words are field name/value pairs providing detailed information about the error. Fields `SQLSTATE`, `condition`, and `message` are always supplied (the first two represent the error code and condition name as shown in [???](#errcodes-appendix)). Fields that may be present include `detail`, `hint`, `context`, `schema`, `table`, `column`, `datatype`, `constraint`, `statement`, `cursor_position`, `filename`, `lineno`, and `funcname`.

A convenient way to work with PL/Tcl's `errorCode` information is to load it into an array, so that the field names become array subscripts. Code for doing that might look like

    if {[catch { spi_exec $sql_command }]} {
        if {[lindex $::errorCode 0] == "POSTGRES"} {
            array set errorArray $::errorCode
            if {$errorArray(condition) == "undefined_table"} {
                # deal with missing table
            } else {
                # deal with some other type of SQL error
            }
        }
    }

(The double colons explicitly specify that `errorCode` is a global variable.)

## Explicit Subtransactions in PL/Tcl

subtransactions

in PL/Tcl

Recovering from errors caused by database access as described in [Error Handling in PL/Tcl](#pltcl-error-handling) can lead to an undesirable situation where some operations succeed before one of them fails, and after recovering from that error the data is left in an inconsistent state. PL/Tcl offers a solution to this problem in the form of explicit subtransactions.

Consider a function that implements a transfer between two accounts:

    CREATE FUNCTION transfer_funds() RETURNS void AS $$
        if [catch {
            spi_exec "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_name = 'joe'"
            spi_exec "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_name = 'mary'"
        } errormsg] {
            set result [format "error transferring funds: %s" $errormsg]
        } else {
            set result "funds transferred successfully"
        }
        spi_exec "INSERT INTO operations (result) VALUES ('[quote $result]')"
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

If the second `UPDATE` statement results in an exception being raised, this function will log the failure, but the result of the first `UPDATE` will nevertheless be committed. In other words, the funds will be withdrawn from Joe's account, but will not be transferred to Mary's account. This happens because each `spi_exec` is a separate subtransaction, and only one of those subtransactions got rolled back.

To handle such cases, you can wrap multiple database operations in an explicit subtransaction, which will succeed or roll back as a whole. PL/Tcl provides a `subtransaction` command to manage this. We can rewrite our function as:

    CREATE FUNCTION transfer_funds2() RETURNS void AS $$
        if [catch {
            subtransaction {
                spi_exec "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_name = 'joe'"
                spi_exec "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_name = 'mary'"
            }
        } errormsg] {
            set result [format "error transferring funds: %s" $errormsg]
        } else {
            set result "funds transferred successfully"
        }
        spi_exec "INSERT INTO operations (result) VALUES ('[quote $result]')"
    $$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

Note that use of `catch` is still required for this purpose. Otherwise the error would propagate to the top level of the function, preventing the desired insertion into the operations table. The `subtransaction` command does not trap errors, it only assures that all database operations executed inside its scope will be rolled back together when an error is reported.

A rollback of an explicit subtransaction occurs on any error reported by the contained Tcl code, not only errors originating from database access. Thus a regular Tcl exception raised inside a `subtransaction` command will also cause the subtransaction to be rolled back. However, non-error exits out of the contained Tcl code (for instance, due to `return`) do not cause a rollback.

## Transaction Management

In a procedure called from the top level or an anonymous code block (`DO` command) called from the top level it is possible to control transactions. To commit the current transaction, call the `commit` command. To roll back the current transaction, call the `rollback` command. (Note that it is not possible to run the SQL commands `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` via `spi_exec` or similar. It has to be done using these functions.) After a transaction is ended, a new transaction is automatically started, so there is no separate command for that.

Here is an example:

    CREATE PROCEDURE transaction_test1()
    LANGUAGE pltcl
    AS $$
    for {set i 0} {$i < 10} {incr i} {
        spi_exec "INSERT INTO test1 (a) VALUES ($i)"
        if {$i % 2 == 0} {
            commit
        } else {
            rollback
        }
    }
    $$;

    CALL transaction_test1();

Transactions cannot be ended when an explicit subtransaction is active.

## PL/Tcl Configuration

This section lists configuration parameters that affect PL/Tcl.

This parameter, if set to a nonempty string, specifies the name (possibly schema-qualified) of a parameterless PL/Tcl function that is to be executed whenever a new Tcl interpreter is created for PL/Tcl. Such a function can perform per-session initialization, such as loading additional Tcl code. A new Tcl interpreter is created when a PL/Tcl function is first executed in a database session, or when an additional interpreter has to be created because a PL/Tcl function is called by a new SQL role.

The referenced function must be written in the `pltcl` language, and must not be marked `SECURITY DEFINER`. (These restrictions ensure that it runs in the interpreter it's supposed to initialize.) The current user must have permission to call it, too.

If the function fails with an error it will abort the function call that caused the new interpreter to be created and propagate out to the calling query, causing the current transaction or subtransaction to be aborted. Any actions already done within Tcl won't be undone; however, that interpreter won't be used again. If the language is used again the initialization will be attempted again within a fresh Tcl interpreter.

Only superusers can change this setting. Although this setting can be changed within a session, such changes will not affect Tcl interpreters that have already been created.

`pltclu.start_proc` (`string`) <span class="indexterm"></span>  
This parameter is exactly like `pltcl.start_proc`, except that it applies to PL/TclU. The referenced function must be written in the `pltclu` language.

## Tcl Procedure Names

In PostgreSQL, the same function name can be used for different function definitions as long as the number of arguments or their types differ. Tcl, however, requires all procedure names to be distinct. PL/Tcl deals with this by making the internal Tcl procedure names contain the object ID of the function from the system table pg_proc as part of their name. Thus, PostgreSQL functions with the same name and different argument types will be different Tcl procedures, too. This is not normally a concern for a PL/Tcl programmer, but it might be visible when debugging.
