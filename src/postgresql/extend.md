## Extending SQL

extending SQL

In the sections that follow, we will discuss how you can extend the PostgreSQL SQL query language by adding:

- functions (starting in [???](#xfunc))
- aggregates (starting in [???](#xaggr))
- data types (starting in [???](#xtypes))
- operators (starting in [???](#xoper))
- operator classes for indexes (starting in [???](#xindex))
- packages of related objects (starting in [Packaging Related Objects into an Extension](#extend-extensions))

## How Extensibility Works

PostgreSQL is extensible because its operation is catalog-driven. If you are familiar with standard relational database systems, you know that they store information about databases, tables, columns, etc., in what are commonly known as system catalogs. (Some systems call this the data dictionary.) The catalogs appear to the user as tables like any other, but the DBMS stores its internal bookkeeping in them. One key difference between PostgreSQL and standard relational database systems is that PostgreSQL stores much more information in its catalogs: not only information about tables and columns, but also information about data types, functions, access methods, and so on. These tables can be modified by the user, and since PostgreSQL bases its operation on these tables, this means that PostgreSQL can be extended by users. By comparison, conventional database systems can only be extended by changing hardcoded procedures in the source code or by loading modules specially written by the DBMS vendor.

The PostgreSQL server can moreover incorporate user-written code into itself through dynamic loading. That is, the user can specify an object code file (e.g., a shared library) that implements a new type or function, and PostgreSQL will load it as required. Code written in SQL is even more trivial to add to the server. This ability to modify its operation “on the fly” makes PostgreSQL uniquely suited for rapid prototyping of new applications and storage structures.

## The PostgreSQL Type System

PostgreSQL data types can be divided into base types, container types, domains, and pseudo-types.

### Base Types

Base types are those, like `integer`, that are implemented below the level of the SQL language (typically in a low-level language such as C). They generally correspond to what are often known as abstract data types. PostgreSQL can only operate on such types through functions provided by the user and only understands the behavior of such types to the extent that the user describes them. The built-in base types are described in [???](#datatype).

Enumerated (enum) types can be considered as a subcategory of base types. The main difference is that they can be created using just SQL commands, without any low-level programming. Refer to [???](#datatype-enum) for more information.

### Container Types

PostgreSQL has three kinds of “container” types, which are types that contain multiple values of other types. These are arrays, composites, and ranges.

Arrays can hold multiple values that are all of the same type. An array type is automatically created for each base type, composite type, range type, and domain type. But there are no arrays of arrays. So far as the type system is concerned, multi-dimensional arrays are the same as one-dimensional arrays. Refer to [???](#arrays) for more information.

Composite types, or row types, are created whenever the user creates a table. It is also possible to use [???](#sql-createtype) to define a “stand-alone” composite type with no associated table. A composite type is simply a list of types with associated field names. A value of a composite type is a row or record of field values. Refer to [???](#rowtypes) for more information.

A range type can hold two values of the same type, which are the lower and upper bounds of the range. Range types are user-created, although a few built-in ones exist. Refer to [???](#rangetypes) for more information.

### Domains

A domain is based on a particular underlying type and for many purposes is interchangeable with its underlying type. However, a domain can have constraints that restrict its valid values to a subset of what the underlying type would allow. Domains are created using the SQL command [???](#sql-createdomain). Refer to [???](#domains) for more information.

### Pseudo-Types

There are a few “pseudo-types” for special purposes. Pseudo-types cannot appear as columns of tables or components of container types, but they can be used to declare the argument and result types of functions. This provides a mechanism within the type system to identify special classes of functions. [???](#datatype-pseudotypes-table) lists the existing pseudo-types.

### Polymorphic Types

polymorphic type

polymorphic function

data type

polymorphic

polymorphic

Some pseudo-types of special interest are the polymorphic types, which are used to declare polymorphic functions. This powerful feature allows a single function definition to operate on many different data types, with the specific data type(s) being determined by the data types actually passed to it in a particular call. The polymorphic types are shown in [Polymorphic Types](#extend-types-polymorphic-table). Some examples of their use appear in [???](#xfunc-sql-polymorphic-functions).

| Name | Family | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `anyelement` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any data type |
| `anyarray` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any array data type |
| `anynonarray` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any non-array data type |
| `anyenum` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any enum data type (see [???](#datatype-enum)) |
| `anyrange` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any range data type (see [???](#rangetypes)) |
| `anymultirange` | Simple | Indicates that a function accepts any multirange data type (see [???](#rangetypes)) |
| `anycompatible` | Common | Indicates that a function accepts any data type, with automatic promotion of multiple arguments to a common data type |
| `anycompatiblearray` | Common | Indicates that a function accepts any array data type, with automatic promotion of multiple arguments to a common data type |
| `anycompatiblenonarray` | Common | Indicates that a function accepts any non-array data type, with automatic promotion of multiple arguments to a common data type |
| `anycompatiblerange` | Common | Indicates that a function accepts any range data type, with automatic promotion of multiple arguments to a common data type |
| `anycompatiblemultirange` | Common | Indicates that a function accepts any multirange data type, with automatic promotion of multiple arguments to a common data type |

Polymorphic Types {#extend-types-polymorphic-table}

Polymorphic arguments and results are tied to each other and are resolved to specific data types when a query calling a polymorphic function is parsed. When there is more than one polymorphic argument, the actual data types of the input values must match up as described below. If the function's result type is polymorphic, or it has output parameters of polymorphic types, the types of those results are deduced from the actual types of the polymorphic inputs as described below.

For the “simple” family of polymorphic types, the matching and deduction rules work like this:

Each position (either argument or return value) declared as `anyelement` is allowed to have any specific actual data type, but in any given call they must all be the *same* actual type. Each position declared as `anyarray` can have any array data type, but similarly they must all be the same type. And similarly, positions declared as `anyrange` must all be the same range type. Likewise for `anymultirange`.

Furthermore, if there are positions declared `anyarray` and others declared `anyelement`, the actual array type in the `anyarray` positions must be an array whose elements are the same type appearing in the `anyelement` positions. `anynonarray` is treated exactly the same as `anyelement`, but adds the additional constraint that the actual type must not be an array type. `anyenum` is treated exactly the same as `anyelement`, but adds the additional constraint that the actual type must be an enum type.

Similarly, if there are positions declared `anyrange` and others declared `anyelement` or `anyarray`, the actual range type in the `anyrange` positions must be a range whose subtype is the same type appearing in the `anyelement` positions and the same as the element type of the `anyarray` positions. If there are positions declared `anymultirange`, their actual multirange type must contain ranges matching parameters declared `anyrange` and base elements matching parameters declared `anyelement` and `anyarray`.

Thus, when more than one argument position is declared with a polymorphic type, the net effect is that only certain combinations of actual argument types are allowed. For example, a function declared as `equal(anyelement, anyelement)` will take any two input values, so long as they are of the same data type.

When the return value of a function is declared as a polymorphic type, there must be at least one argument position that is also polymorphic, and the actual data type(s) supplied for the polymorphic arguments determine the actual result type for that call. For example, if there were not already an array subscripting mechanism, one could define a function that implements subscripting as `subscript(anyarray, integer) returns anyelement`. This declaration constrains the actual first argument to be an array type, and allows the parser to infer the correct result type from the actual first argument's type. Another example is that a function declared as `f(anyarray) returns anyenum` will only accept arrays of enum types.

In most cases, the parser can infer the actual data type for a polymorphic result type from arguments that are of a different polymorphic type in the same family; for example `anyarray` can be deduced from `anyelement` or vice versa. An exception is that a polymorphic result of type `anyrange` requires an argument of type `anyrange`; it cannot be deduced from `anyarray` or `anyelement` arguments. This is because there could be multiple range types with the same subtype.

Note that `anynonarray` and `anyenum` do not represent separate type variables; they are the same type as `anyelement`, just with an additional constraint. For example, declaring a function as `f(anyelement, anyenum)` is equivalent to declaring it as `f(anyenum, anyenum)`: both actual arguments have to be the same enum type.

For the “common” family of polymorphic types, the matching and deduction rules work approximately the same as for the “simple” family, with one major difference: the actual types of the arguments need not be identical, so long as they can be implicitly cast to a single common type. The common type is selected following the same rules as for `UNION` and related constructs (see [???](#typeconv-union-case)). Selection of the common type considers the actual types of `anycompatible` and `anycompatiblenonarray` inputs, the array element types of `anycompatiblearray` inputs, the range subtypes of `anycompatiblerange` inputs, and the multirange subtypes of `anycompatiblemultirange` inputs. If `anycompatiblenonarray` is present then the common type is required to be a non-array type. Once a common type is identified, arguments in `anycompatible` and `anycompatiblenonarray` positions are automatically cast to that type, and arguments in `anycompatiblearray` positions are automatically cast to the array type for that type.

Since there is no way to select a range type knowing only its subtype, use of `anycompatiblerange` and/or `anycompatiblemultirange` requires that all arguments declared with that type have the same actual range and/or multirange type, and that that type's subtype agree with the selected common type, so that no casting of the range values is required. As with `anyrange` and `anymultirange`, use of `anycompatiblerange` and `anymultirange` as a function result type requires that there be an `anycompatiblerange` or `anycompatiblemultirange` argument.

Notice that there is no `anycompatibleenum` type. Such a type would not be very useful, since there normally are not any implicit casts to enum types, meaning that there would be no way to resolve a common type for dissimilar enum inputs.

The “simple” and “common” polymorphic families represent two independent sets of type variables. Consider for example

    CREATE FUNCTION myfunc(a anyelement, b anyelement,
                           c anycompatible, d anycompatible)
    RETURNS anycompatible AS ...

In an actual call of this function, the first two inputs must have exactly the same type. The last two inputs must be promotable to a common type, but this type need not have anything to do with the type of the first two inputs. The result will have the common type of the last two inputs.

A variadic function (one taking a variable number of arguments, as in [???](#xfunc-sql-variadic-functions)) can be polymorphic: this is accomplished by declaring its last parameter as `VARIADIC` `anyarray` or `VARIADIC` `anycompatiblearray`. For purposes of argument matching and determining the actual result type, such a function behaves the same as if you had written the appropriate number of `anynonarray` or `anycompatiblenonarray` parameters.

## Packaging Related Objects into an Extension

extension

A useful extension to PostgreSQL typically includes multiple SQL objects; for example, a new data type will require new functions, new operators, and probably new index operator classes. It is helpful to collect all these objects into a single package to simplify database management. PostgreSQL calls such a package an extension. To define an extension, you need at least a script file that contains the SQL commands to create the extension's objects, and a control file that specifies a few basic properties of the extension itself. If the extension includes C code, there will typically also be a shared library file into which the C code has been built. Once you have these files, a simple [`CREATE EXTENSION`](#sql-createextension) command loads the objects into your database.

The main advantage of using an extension, rather than just running the SQL script to load a bunch of “loose” objects into your database, is that PostgreSQL will then understand that the objects of the extension go together. You can drop all the objects with a single [`DROP EXTENSION`](#sql-dropextension) command (no need to maintain a separate “uninstall” script). Even more useful, pg_dump knows that it should not dump the individual member objects of the extension it will just include a `CREATE EXTENSION` command in dumps, instead. This vastly simplifies migration to a new version of the extension that might contain more or different objects than the old version. Note however that you must have the extension's control, script, and other files available when loading such a dump into a new database.

PostgreSQL will not let you drop an individual object contained in an extension, except by dropping the whole extension. Also, while you can change the definition of an extension member object (for example, via `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` for a function), bear in mind that the modified definition will not be dumped by pg_dump. Such a change is usually only sensible if you concurrently make the same change in the extension's script file. (But there are special provisions for tables containing configuration data; see [Extension Configuration Tables](#extend-extensions-config-tables).) In production situations, it's generally better to create an extension update script to perform changes to extension member objects.

The extension script may set privileges on objects that are part of the extension, using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements. The final set of privileges for each object (if any are set) will be stored in the [pg_init_privs](#catalog-pg-init-privs) system catalog. When pg_dump is used, the `CREATE EXTENSION` command will be included in the dump, followed by the set of `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements necessary to set the privileges on the objects to what they were at the time the dump was taken.

PostgreSQL does not currently support extension scripts issuing `CREATE POLICY` or `SECURITY LABEL` statements. These are expected to be set after the extension has been created. All RLS policies and security labels on extension objects will be included in dumps created by pg_dump.

The extension mechanism also has provisions for packaging modification scripts that adjust the definitions of the SQL objects contained in an extension. For example, if version 1.1 of an extension adds one function and changes the body of another function compared to 1.0, the extension author can provide an update script that makes just those two changes. The `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` command can then be used to apply these changes and track which version of the extension is actually installed in a given database.

The kinds of SQL objects that can be members of an extension are shown in the description of [`ALTER EXTENSION`](#sql-alterextension). Notably, objects that are database-cluster-wide, such as databases, roles, and tablespaces, cannot be extension members since an extension is only known within one database. (Although an extension script is not prohibited from creating such objects, if it does so they will not be tracked as part of the extension.) Also notice that while a table can be a member of an extension, its subsidiary objects such as indexes are not directly considered members of the extension. Another important point is that schemas can belong to extensions, but not vice versa: an extension as such has an unqualified name and does not exist “within” any schema. The extension's member objects, however, will belong to schemas whenever appropriate for their object types. It may or may not be appropriate for an extension to own the schema(s) its member objects are within.

If an extension's script creates any temporary objects (such as temp tables), those objects are treated as extension members for the remainder of the current session, but are automatically dropped at session end, as any temporary object would be. This is an exception to the rule that extension member objects cannot be dropped without dropping the whole extension.

### Extension Files

control file

The `CREATE EXTENSION` command relies on a control file for each extension, which must be named the same as the extension with a suffix of `.control`, and must be placed in the installation's `SHAREDIR/extension` directory. There must also be at least one SQL script file, which follows the naming pattern `extension--version.sql` (for example, `foo--1.0.sql` for version `1.0` of extension `foo`). By default, the script file(s) are also placed in the `SHAREDIR/extension` directory; but the control file can specify a different directory for the script file(s).

The file format for an extension control file is the same as for the `postgresql.conf` file, namely a list of \<parameter_name\> `=` \<value\> assignments, one per line. Blank lines and comments introduced by `#` are allowed. Be sure to quote any value that is not a single word or number.

A control file can set the following parameters:

`directory` (`string`)  
The directory containing the extension's SQL script file(s). Unless an absolute path is given, the name is relative to the installation's `SHAREDIR` directory. The default behavior is equivalent to specifying `directory = 'extension'`.

`default_version` (`string`)  
The default version of the extension (the one that will be installed if no version is specified in `CREATE EXTENSION`). Although this can be omitted, that will result in `CREATE EXTENSION` failing if no `VERSION` option appears, so you generally don't want to do that.

`comment` (`string`)  
A comment (any string) about the extension. The comment is applied when initially creating an extension, but not during extension updates (since that might override user-added comments). Alternatively, the extension's comment can be set by writing a [???](#sql-comment) command in the script file.

`encoding` (`string`)  
The character set encoding used by the script file(s). This should be specified if the script files contain any non-ASCII characters. Otherwise the files will be assumed to be in the database encoding.

`module_pathname` (`string`)  
The value of this parameter will be substituted for each occurrence of `MODULE_PATHNAME` in the script file(s). If it is not set, no substitution is made. Typically, this is set to `$libdir/shared_library_name` and then `MODULE_PATHNAME` is used in `CREATE FUNCTION` commands for C-language functions, so that the script files do not need to hard-wire the name of the shared library.

`requires` (`string`)  
A list of names of extensions that this extension depends on, for example `requires = 'foo, bar'`. Those extensions must be installed before this one can be installed.

`no_relocate` (`string`)  
A list of names of extensions that this extension depends on that should be barred from changing their schemas via `ALTER EXTENSION ... SET SCHEMA`. This is needed if this extension's script references the name of a required extension's schema (using the `@extschema:name@` syntax) in a way that cannot track renames.

`superuser` (`boolean`)  
If this parameter is `true` (which is the default), only superusers can create the extension or update it to a new version (but see also `trusted`, below). If it is set to `false`, just the privileges required to execute the commands in the installation or update script are required. This should normally be set to `true` if any of the script commands require superuser privileges. (Such commands would fail anyway, but it's more user-friendly to give the error up front.)

`trusted` (`boolean`)  
This parameter, if set to `true` (which is not the default), allows some non-superusers to install an extension that has `superuser` set to `true`. Specifically, installation will be permitted for anyone who has `CREATE` privilege on the current database. When the user executing `CREATE EXTENSION` is not a superuser but is allowed to install by virtue of this parameter, then the installation or update script is run as the bootstrap superuser, not as the calling user. This parameter is irrelevant if `superuser` is `false`. Generally, this should not be set true for extensions that could allow access to otherwise-superuser-only abilities, such as file system access. Also, marking an extension trusted requires significant extra effort to write the extension's installation and update script(s) securely; see [Security Considerations for Extensions](#extend-extensions-security).

`relocatable` (`boolean`)  
An extension is relocatable if it is possible to move its contained objects into a different schema after initial creation of the extension. The default is `false`, i.e., the extension is not relocatable. See [Extension Relocatability](#extend-extensions-relocation) for more information.

`schema` (`string`)  
This parameter can only be set for non-relocatable extensions. It forces the extension to be loaded into exactly the named schema and not any other. The `schema` parameter is consulted only when initially creating an extension, not during extension updates. See [Extension Relocatability](#extend-extensions-relocation) for more information.

In addition to the primary control file `extension.control`, an extension can have secondary control files named in the style `extension--version.control`. If supplied, these must be located in the script file directory. Secondary control files follow the same format as the primary control file. Any parameters set in a secondary control file override the primary control file when installing or updating to that version of the extension. However, the parameters `directory` and `default_version` cannot be set in a secondary control file.

An extension's SQL script files can contain any SQL commands, except for transaction control commands (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, etc.) and commands that cannot be executed inside a transaction block (such as `VACUUM`). This is because the script files are implicitly executed within a transaction block.

An extension's SQL script files can also contain lines beginning with `\echo`, which will be ignored (treated as comments) by the extension mechanism. This provision is commonly used to throw an error if the script file is fed to psql rather than being loaded via `CREATE EXTENSION` (see example script in [Extension Example](#extend-extensions-example)). Without that, users might accidentally load the extension's contents as “loose” objects rather than as an extension, a state of affairs that's a bit tedious to recover from.

If the extension script contains the string `@extowner@`, that string is replaced with the (suitably quoted) name of the user calling `CREATE EXTENSION` or `ALTER EXTENSION`. Typically this feature is used by extensions that are marked trusted to assign ownership of selected objects to the calling user rather than the bootstrap superuser. (One should be careful about doing so, however. For example, assigning ownership of a C-language function to a non-superuser would create a privilege escalation path for that user.)

While the script files can contain any characters allowed by the specified encoding, control files should contain only plain ASCII, because there is no way for PostgreSQL to know what encoding a control file is in. In practice this is only an issue if you want to use non-ASCII characters in the extension's comment. Recommended practice in that case is to not use the control file `comment` parameter, but instead use `COMMENT ON EXTENSION` within a script file to set the comment.

### Extension Relocatability

Users often wish to load the objects contained in an extension into a different schema than the extension's author had in mind. There are three supported levels of relocatability:

- A fully relocatable extension can be moved into another schema at any time, even after it's been loaded into a database. This is done with the `ALTER EXTENSION SET SCHEMA` command, which automatically renames all the member objects into the new schema. Normally, this is only possible if the extension contains no internal assumptions about what schema any of its objects are in. Also, the extension's objects must all be in one schema to begin with (ignoring objects that do not belong to any schema, such as procedural languages). Mark a fully relocatable extension by setting `relocatable = true` in its control file.

- An extension might be relocatable during installation but not afterwards. This is typically the case if the extension's script file needs to reference the target schema explicitly, for example in setting `search_path` properties for SQL functions. For such an extension, set `relocatable = false` in its control file, and use `@extschema@` to refer to the target schema in the script file. All occurrences of this string will be replaced by the actual target schema's name (double-quoted if necessary) before the script is executed. The user can set the target schema using the `SCHEMA` option of `CREATE EXTENSION`.

- If the extension does not support relocation at all, set `relocatable = false` in its control file, and also set `schema` to the name of the intended target schema. This will prevent use of the `SCHEMA` option of `CREATE EXTENSION`, unless it specifies the same schema named in the control file. This choice is typically necessary if the extension contains internal assumptions about its schema name that can't be replaced by uses of `@extschema@`. The `@extschema@` substitution mechanism is available in this case too, although it is of limited use since the schema name is determined by the control file.

In all cases, the script file will be executed with [???](#guc-search-path) initially set to point to the target schema; that is, `CREATE EXTENSION` does the equivalent of this:

    SET LOCAL search_path TO @extschema@, pg_temp;

This allows the objects created by the script file to go into the target schema. The script file can change `search_path` if it wishes, but that is generally undesirable. `search_path` is restored to its previous setting upon completion of `CREATE EXTENSION`.

The target schema is determined by the `schema` parameter in the control file if that is given, otherwise by the `SCHEMA` option of `CREATE EXTENSION` if that is given, otherwise the current default object creation schema (the first one in the caller's `search_path`). When the control file `schema` parameter is used, the target schema will be created if it doesn't already exist, but in the other two cases it must already exist.

If any prerequisite extensions are listed in `requires` in the control file, their target schemas are added to the initial setting of `search_path`, following the new extension's target schema. This allows their objects to be visible to the new extension's script file.

For security, `pg_temp` is automatically appended to the end of `search_path` in all cases.

Although a non-relocatable extension can contain objects spread across multiple schemas, it is usually desirable to place all the objects meant for external use into a single schema, which is considered the extension's target schema. Such an arrangement works conveniently with the default setting of `search_path` during creation of dependent extensions.

If an extension references objects belonging to another extension, it is recommended to schema-qualify those references. To do that, write `@extschema:name@` in the extension's script file, where \<name\> is the name of the other extension (which must be listed in this extension's `requires` list). This string will be replaced by the name (double-quoted if necessary) of that extension's target schema. Although this notation avoids the need to make hard-wired assumptions about schema names in the extension's script file, its use may embed the other extension's schema name into the installed objects of this extension. (Typically, that happens when `@extschema:name@` is used inside a string literal, such as a function body or a `search_path` setting. In other cases, the object reference is reduced to an OID during parsing and does not require subsequent lookups.) If the other extension's schema name is so embedded, you should prevent the other extension from being relocated after yours is installed, by adding the name of the other extension to this one's `no_relocate` list.

### Extension Configuration Tables

Some extensions include configuration tables, which contain data that might be added or changed by the user after installation of the extension. Ordinarily, if a table is part of an extension, neither the table's definition nor its content will be dumped by pg_dump. But that behavior is undesirable for a configuration table; any data changes made by the user need to be included in dumps, or the extension will behave differently after a dump and restore.

pg_extension_config_dump

To solve this problem, an extension's script file can mark a table or a sequence it has created as a configuration relation, which will cause pg_dump to include the table's or the sequence's contents (not its definition) in dumps. To do that, call the function `pg_extension_config_dump(regclass, text)` after creating the table or the sequence, for example

    CREATE TABLE my_config (key text, value text);
    CREATE SEQUENCE my_config_seq;

    SELECT pg_catalog.pg_extension_config_dump('my_config', '');
    SELECT pg_catalog.pg_extension_config_dump('my_config_seq', '');

Any number of tables or sequences can be marked this way. Sequences associated with `serial` or `bigserial` columns can be marked as well.

When the second argument of `pg_extension_config_dump` is an empty string, the entire contents of the table are dumped by pg_dump. This is usually only correct if the table is initially empty as created by the extension script. If there is a mixture of initial data and user-provided data in the table, the second argument of `pg_extension_config_dump` provides a `WHERE` condition that selects the data to be dumped. For example, you might do

    CREATE TABLE my_config (key text, value text, standard_entry boolean);

    SELECT pg_catalog.pg_extension_config_dump('my_config', 'WHERE NOT standard_entry');

and then make sure that standard_entry is true only in the rows created by the extension's script.

For sequences, the second argument of `pg_extension_config_dump` has no effect.

More complicated situations, such as initially-provided rows that might be modified by users, can be handled by creating triggers on the configuration table to ensure that modified rows are marked correctly.

You can alter the filter condition associated with a configuration table by calling `pg_extension_config_dump` again. (This would typically be useful in an extension update script.) The only way to mark a table as no longer a configuration table is to dissociate it from the extension with `ALTER EXTENSION ... DROP TABLE`.

Note that foreign key relationships between these tables will dictate the order in which the tables are dumped out by pg_dump. Specifically, pg_dump will attempt to dump the referenced-by table before the referencing table. As the foreign key relationships are set up at CREATE EXTENSION time (prior to data being loaded into the tables) circular dependencies are not supported. When circular dependencies exist, the data will still be dumped out but the dump will not be able to be restored directly and user intervention will be required.

Sequences associated with `serial` or `bigserial` columns need to be directly marked to dump their state. Marking their parent relation is not enough for this purpose.

### Extension Updates

One advantage of the extension mechanism is that it provides convenient ways to manage updates to the SQL commands that define an extension's objects. This is done by associating a version name or number with each released version of the extension's installation script. In addition, if you want users to be able to update their databases dynamically from one version to the next, you should provide update scripts that make the necessary changes to go from one version to the next. Update scripts have names following the pattern `extension--old_version--target_version.sql` (for example, `foo--1.0--1.1.sql` contains the commands to modify version `1.0` of extension `foo` into version `1.1`).

Given that a suitable update script is available, the command `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` will update an installed extension to the specified new version. The update script is run in the same environment that `CREATE EXTENSION` provides for installation scripts: in particular, `search_path` is set up in the same way, and any new objects created by the script are automatically added to the extension. Also, if the script chooses to drop extension member objects, they are automatically dissociated from the extension.

If an extension has secondary control files, the control parameters that are used for an update script are those associated with the script's target (new) version.

`ALTER EXTENSION` is able to execute sequences of update script files to achieve a requested update. For example, if only `foo--1.0--1.1.sql` and `foo--1.1--2.0.sql` are available, `ALTER EXTENSION` will apply them in sequence if an update to version `2.0` is requested when `1.0` is currently installed.

PostgreSQL doesn't assume anything about the properties of version names: for example, it does not know whether `1.1` follows `1.0`. It just matches up the available version names and follows the path that requires applying the fewest update scripts. (A version name can actually be any string that doesn't contain `--` or leading or trailing `-`.)

Sometimes it is useful to provide “downgrade” scripts, for example `foo--1.1--1.0.sql` to allow reverting the changes associated with version `1.1`. If you do that, be careful of the possibility that a downgrade script might unexpectedly get applied because it yields a shorter path. The risky case is where there is a “fast path” update script that jumps ahead several versions as well as a downgrade script to the fast path's start point. It might take fewer steps to apply the downgrade and then the fast path than to move ahead one version at a time. If the downgrade script drops any irreplaceable objects, this will yield undesirable results.

To check for unexpected update paths, use this command:

    SELECT * FROM pg_extension_update_paths('extension_name');

This shows each pair of distinct known version names for the specified extension, together with the update path sequence that would be taken to get from the source version to the target version, or `NULL` if there is no available update path. The path is shown in textual form with `--` separators. You can use `regexp_split_to_array(path,'--')` if you prefer an array format.

### Installing Extensions Using Update Scripts

An extension that has been around for awhile will probably exist in several versions, for which the author will need to write update scripts. For example, if you have released a `foo` extension in versions `1.0`, `1.1`, and `1.2`, there should be update scripts `foo--1.0--1.1.sql` and `foo--1.1--1.2.sql`. Before PostgreSQL 10, it was necessary to also create new script files `foo--1.1.sql` and `foo--1.2.sql` that directly build the newer extension versions, or else the newer versions could not be installed directly, only by installing `1.0` and then updating. That was tedious and duplicative, but now it's unnecessary, because `CREATE EXTENSION` can follow update chains automatically. For example, if only the script files `foo--1.0.sql`, `foo--1.0--1.1.sql`, and `foo--1.1--1.2.sql` are available then a request to install version `1.2` is honored by running those three scripts in sequence. The processing is the same as if you'd first installed `1.0` and then updated to `1.2`. (As with `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`, if multiple pathways are available then the shortest is preferred.) Arranging an extension's script files in this style can reduce the amount of maintenance effort needed to produce small updates.

If you use secondary (version-specific) control files with an extension maintained in this style, keep in mind that each version needs a control file even if it has no stand-alone installation script, as that control file will determine how the implicit update to that version is performed. For example, if `foo--1.0.control` specifies `requires = 'bar'` but `foo`'s other control files do not, the extension's dependency on `bar` will be dropped when updating from `1.0` to another version.

### Security Considerations for Extensions

Widely-distributed extensions should assume little about the database they occupy. Therefore, it's appropriate to write functions provided by an extension in a secure style that cannot be compromised by search-path-based attacks.

An extension that has the `superuser` property set to true must also consider security hazards for the actions taken within its installation and update scripts. It is not terribly difficult for a malicious user to create trojan-horse objects that will compromise later execution of a carelessly-written extension script, allowing that user to acquire superuser privileges.

If an extension is marked `trusted`, then its installation schema can be selected by the installing user, who might intentionally use an insecure schema in hopes of gaining superuser privileges. Therefore, a trusted extension is extremely exposed from a security standpoint, and all its script commands must be carefully examined to ensure that no compromise is possible.

Advice about writing functions securely is provided in [Security Considerations for Extension Functions](#extend-extensions-security-funcs) below, and advice about writing installation scripts securely is provided in [Security Considerations for Extension Scripts](#extend-extensions-security-scripts).

#### Security Considerations for Extension Functions

SQL-language and PL-language functions provided by extensions are at risk of search-path-based attacks when they are executed, since parsing of these functions occurs at execution time not creation time.

The [`CREATE FUNCTION`](#sql-createfunction-security) reference page contains advice about writing `SECURITY DEFINER` functions safely. It's good practice to apply those techniques for any function provided by an extension, since the function might be called by a high-privilege user.

If you cannot set the `search_path` to contain only secure schemas, assume that each unqualified name could resolve to an object that a malicious user has defined. Beware of constructs that depend on `search_path` implicitly; for example, IN and `CASE expression WHEN` always select an operator using the search path. In their place, use `OPERATOR(schema.=) ANY` and `CASE WHEN expression`.

A general-purpose extension usually should not assume that it's been installed into a secure schema, which means that even schema-qualified references to its own objects are not entirely risk-free. For example, if the extension has defined a function `myschema.myfunc(bigint)` then a call such as `myschema.myfunc(42)` could be captured by a hostile function `myschema.myfunc(integer)`. Be careful that the data types of function and operator parameters exactly match the declared argument types, using explicit casts where necessary.

#### Security Considerations for Extension Scripts

An extension installation or update script should be written to guard against search-path-based attacks occurring when the script executes. If an object reference in the script can be made to resolve to some other object than the script author intended, then a compromise might occur immediately, or later when the mis-defined extension object is used.

DDL commands such as `CREATE FUNCTION` and `CREATE OPERATOR CLASS` are generally secure, but beware of any command having a general-purpose expression as a component. For example, `CREATE VIEW` needs to be vetted, as does a `DEFAULT` expression in `CREATE FUNCTION`.

Sometimes an extension script might need to execute general-purpose SQL, for example to make catalog adjustments that aren't possible via DDL. Be careful to execute such commands with a secure `search_path`; do *not* trust the path provided by `CREATE/ALTER EXTENSION` to be secure. Best practice is to temporarily set `search_path` to `pg_catalog, pg_temp` and insert references to the extension's installation schema explicitly where needed. (This practice might also be helpful for creating views.) Examples can be found in the `contrib` modules in the PostgreSQL source code distribution.

Cross-extension references are extremely difficult to make fully secure, partially because of uncertainty about which schema the other extension is in. The hazards are reduced if both extensions are installed in the same schema, because then a hostile object cannot be placed ahead of the referenced extension in the installation-time `search_path`. However, no mechanism currently exists to require that. For now, best practice is to not mark an extension trusted if it depends on another one, unless that other one is always installed in `pg_catalog`.

### Extension Example

Here is a complete example of an SQL-only extension, a two-element composite type that can store any type of value in its slots, which are named “k” and “v”. Non-text values are automatically coerced to text for storage.

The script file `pair--1.0.sql` looks like this:

    -- complain if script is sourced in psql, rather than via CREATE EXTENSION
    \echo Use "CREATE EXTENSION pair" to load this file. \quit

    CREATE TYPE pair AS ( k text, v text );

    CREATE FUNCTION pair(text, text)
    RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::@extschema@.pair;';

    CREATE OPERATOR ~> (LEFTARG = text, RIGHTARG = text, FUNCTION = pair);

    -- "SET search_path" is easy to get right, but qualified names perform better.
    CREATE FUNCTION lower(pair)
    RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL
    AS 'SELECT ROW(lower($1.k), lower($1.v))::@extschema@.pair;'
    SET search_path = pg_temp;

    CREATE FUNCTION pair_concat(pair, pair)
    RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL
    AS 'SELECT ROW($1.k OPERATOR(pg_catalog.||) $2.k,
                   $1.v OPERATOR(pg_catalog.||) $2.v)::@extschema@.pair;';

The control file `pair.control` looks like this:

    # pair extension
    comment = 'A key/value pair data type'
    default_version = '1.0'
    # cannot be relocatable because of use of @extschema@
    relocatable = false

While you hardly need a makefile to install these two files into the correct directory, you could use a `Makefile` containing this:

    EXTENSION = pair
    DATA = pair--1.0.sql

    PG_CONFIG = pg_config
    PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
    include $(PGXS)

This makefile relies on PGXS, which is described in [Extension Building Infrastructure](#extend-pgxs). The command `make install` will install the control and script files into the correct directory as reported by pg_config.

Once the files are installed, use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to load the objects into any particular database.

## Extension Building Infrastructure

pgxs

If you are thinking about distributing your PostgreSQL extension modules, setting up a portable build system for them can be fairly difficult. Therefore the PostgreSQL installation provides a build infrastructure for extensions, called PGXS, so that simple extension modules can be built simply against an already installed server. PGXS is mainly intended for extensions that include C code, although it can be used for pure-SQL extensions too. Note that PGXS is not intended to be a universal build system framework that can be used to build any software interfacing to PostgreSQL; it simply automates common build rules for simple server extension modules. For more complicated packages, you might need to write your own build system.

To use the PGXS infrastructure for your extension, you must write a simple makefile. In the makefile, you need to set some variables and include the global PGXS makefile. Here is an example that builds an extension module named `isbn_issn`, consisting of a shared library containing some C code, an extension control file, an SQL script, an include file (only needed if other modules might need to access the extension functions without going via SQL), and a documentation text file:

    MODULES = isbn_issn
    EXTENSION = isbn_issn
    DATA = isbn_issn--1.0.sql
    DOCS = README.isbn_issn
    HEADERS_isbn_issn = isbn_issn.h

    PG_CONFIG = pg_config
    PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
    include $(PGXS)

The last three lines should always be the same. Earlier in the file, you assign variables or add custom make rules.

Set one of these three variables to specify what is built:

`MODULES`  
list of shared-library objects to be built from source files with same stem (do not include library suffixes in this list)

`MODULE_big`  
a shared library to build from multiple source files (list object files in `OBJS`)

`PROGRAM`  
an executable program to build (list object files in `OBJS`)

The following variables can also be set:

`EXTENSION`  
extension name(s); for each name you must provide an `extension.control` file, which will be installed into `prefix/share/extension`

`MODULEDIR`  
subdirectory of `prefix/share` into which DATA and DOCS files should be installed (if not set, default is `extension` if `EXTENSION` is set, or `contrib` if not)

`DATA`  
random files to install into `prefix/share/$MODULEDIR`

`DATA_built`  
random files to install into `prefix/share/$MODULEDIR`, which need to be built first

`DATA_TSEARCH`  
random files to install under `prefix/share/tsearch_data`

`DOCS`  
random files to install under `prefix/doc/$MODULEDIR`

`HEADERS`; `HEADERS_built`  
Files to (optionally build and) install under `prefix/include/server/$MODULEDIR/$MODULE_big`.

Unlike `DATA_built`, files in `HEADERS_built` are not removed by the `clean` target; if you want them removed, also add them to `EXTRA_CLEAN` or add your own rules to do it.

`HEADERS_$MODULE`; `HEADERS_built_$MODULE`  
Files to install (after building if specified) under `prefix/include/server/$MODULEDIR/$MODULE`, where `$MODULE` must be a module name used in `MODULES` or `MODULE_big`.

Unlike `DATA_built`, files in `HEADERS_built_$MODULE` are not removed by the `clean` target; if you want them removed, also add them to `EXTRA_CLEAN` or add your own rules to do it.

It is legal to use both variables for the same module, or any combination, unless you have two module names in the `MODULES` list that differ only by the presence of a prefix `built_`, which would cause ambiguity. In that (hopefully unlikely) case, you should use only the `HEADERS_built_$MODULE` variables.

`SCRIPTS`  
script files (not binaries) to install into `prefix/bin`

`SCRIPTS_built`  
script files (not binaries) to install into `prefix/bin`, which need to be built first

`REGRESS`  
list of regression test cases (without suffix), see below

`REGRESS_OPTS`  
additional switches to pass to pg_regress

`ISOLATION`  
list of isolation test cases, see below for more details

`ISOLATION_OPTS`  
additional switches to pass to pg_isolation_regress

`TAP_TESTS`  
switch defining if TAP tests need to be run, see below

`NO_INSTALL`  
don't define an `install` target, useful for test modules that don't need their build products to be installed

`NO_INSTALLCHECK`  
don't define an `installcheck` target, useful e.g., if tests require special configuration, or don't use pg_regress

`EXTRA_CLEAN`  
extra files to remove in `make clean`

`PG_CPPFLAGS`  
will be prepended to `CPPFLAGS`

`PG_CFLAGS`  
will be appended to `CFLAGS`

`PG_CXXFLAGS`  
will be appended to `CXXFLAGS`

`PG_LDFLAGS`  
will be prepended to `LDFLAGS`

`PG_LIBS`  
will be added to `PROGRAM` link line

`SHLIB_LINK`  
will be added to `MODULE_big` link line

`PG_CONFIG`  
path to pg_config program for the PostgreSQL installation to build against (typically just `pg_config` to use the first one in your `PATH`)

Put this makefile as `Makefile` in the directory which holds your extension. Then you can do `make` to compile, and then `make install` to install your module. By default, the extension is compiled and installed for the PostgreSQL installation that corresponds to the first `pg_config` program found in your `PATH`. You can use a different installation by setting `PG_CONFIG` to point to its `pg_config` program, either within the makefile or on the `make` command line.

You can also run `make` in a directory outside the source tree of your extension, if you want to keep the build directory separate. This procedure is also called a <span class="indexterm"></span>VPATH build. Here's how:

    mkdir build_dir
    cd build_dir
    make -f /path/to/extension/source/tree/Makefile
    make -f /path/to/extension/source/tree/Makefile install

Alternatively, you can set up a directory for a VPATH build in a similar way to how it is done for the core code. One way to do this is using the core script `config/prep_buildtree`. Once this has been done you can build by setting the `make` variable `VPATH` like this:

    make VPATH=/path/to/extension/source/tree
    make VPATH=/path/to/extension/source/tree install

This procedure can work with a greater variety of directory layouts.

The scripts listed in the `REGRESS` variable are used for regression testing of your module, which can be invoked by `make installcheck` after doing `make install`. For this to work you must have a running PostgreSQL server. The script files listed in `REGRESS` must appear in a subdirectory named `sql/` in your extension's directory. These files must have extension `.sql`, which must not be included in the `REGRESS` list in the makefile. For each test there should also be a file containing the expected output in a subdirectory named `expected/`, with the same stem and extension `.out`. `make installcheck` executes each test script with psql, and compares the resulting output to the matching expected file. Any differences will be written to the file `regression.diffs` in `diff -c` format. Note that trying to run a test that is missing its expected file will be reported as “trouble”, so make sure you have all expected files.

The scripts listed in the `ISOLATION` variable are used for tests stressing behavior of concurrent session with your module, which can be invoked by `make installcheck` after doing `make install`. For this to work you must have a running PostgreSQL server. The script files listed in `ISOLATION` must appear in a subdirectory named `specs/` in your extension's directory. These files must have extension `.spec`, which must not be included in the `ISOLATION` list in the makefile. For each test there should also be a file containing the expected output in a subdirectory named `expected/`, with the same stem and extension `.out`. `make installcheck` executes each test script, and compares the resulting output to the matching expected file. Any differences will be written to the file `output_iso/regression.diffs` in `diff -c` format. Note that trying to run a test that is missing its expected file will be reported as “trouble”, so make sure you have all expected files.

`TAP_TESTS` enables the use of TAP tests. Data from each run is present in a subdirectory named `tmp_check/`. See also [???](#regress-tap) for more details.

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to create the expected files is to create empty files, then do a test run (which will of course report differences). Inspect the actual result files found in the `results/` directory (for tests in `REGRESS`), or `output_iso/results/` directory (for tests in `ISOLATION`), then copy them to `expected/` if they match what you expect from the test.
