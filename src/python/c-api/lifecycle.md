# Object Life Cycle

This section explains how a type's slots relate to each other
throughout the life of an object.  It is not intended to be a complete
canonical reference for the slots; instead, refer to the slot-specific
documentation in Type Object Structures for details about a particular
slot.

## Life Events

The figure below illustrates the order of events that can occur
throughout an object's life.  An arrow from *A* to *B* indicates that
event *B* can occur after event *A* has occurred, with the arrow's
label indicating the condition that must be true for *B* to occur
after *A*.

detail below.][imagen]

Explanation:

* When a new object is constructed by calling its type:

  1. "tp_new" is called to create a new object.

  2. "tp_alloc" is directly called by "tp_new" to allocate the memory
     for the new object.

  3. "tp_init" initializes the newly created object. "tp_init" can be
     called again to re-initialize an object, if desired. The
     "tp_init" call can also be skipped entirely, for example by
     Python code calling "__new__()".

* After "tp_init" completes, the object is ready to use.

* Some time after the last reference to an object is removed:

  1. If an object is not marked as *finalized*, it might be finalized
     by marking it as *finalized* and calling its "tp_finalize"
     function.  Python does *not* finalize an object when the last
     reference to it is deleted; use
     "PyObject_CallFinalizerFromDealloc()" to ensure that
     "tp_finalize" is always called.

  2. If the object is marked as finalized, "tp_clear" might be called
     by the garbage collector to clear references held by the object.
     It is *not* called when the object's reference count reaches
     zero.

  3. "tp_dealloc" is called to destroy the object. To avoid code
     duplication, "tp_dealloc" typically calls into "tp_clear" to free
     up the object's references.

  4. When "tp_dealloc" finishes object destruction, it directly calls
     "tp_free" (usually set to "PyObject_Free()" or
     "PyObject_GC_Del()" automatically as appropriate for the type) to
     deallocate the memory.

* The "tp_finalize" function is permitted to add a reference to the
  object if desired.  If it does, the object is *resurrected*,
  preventing its pending destruction.  (Only "tp_finalize" is allowed
  to resurrect an object; "tp_clear" and "tp_dealloc" cannot without
  calling into "tp_finalize".)  Resurrecting an object may or may not
  cause the object's *finalized* mark to be removed.  Currently,
  Python does not remove the *finalized* mark from a resurrected
  object if it supports garbage collection (i.e., the
  "Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC" flag is set) but does remove the mark if the
  object does not support garbage collection; either or both of these
  behaviors may change in the future.

* "tp_dealloc" can optionally call "tp_finalize" via
  "PyObject_CallFinalizerFromDealloc()" if it wishes to reuse that
  code to help with object destruction.  This is recommended because
  it guarantees that "tp_finalize" is always called before
  destruction.  See the "tp_dealloc" documentation for example code.

* If the object is a member of a *cyclic isolate* and either
  "tp_clear" fails to break the reference cycle or the cyclic isolate
  is not detected (perhaps "gc.disable()" was called, or the
  "Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC" flag was erroneously omitted in one of the
  involved types), the objects remain indefinitely uncollectable (they
  "leak").  See "gc.garbage".

If the object is marked as supporting garbage collection (the
"Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC" flag is set in "tp_flags"), the following events
are also possible:

* The garbage collector occasionally calls "tp_traverse" to identify
  *cyclic isolates*.

* When the garbage collector discovers a *cyclic isolate*, it
  finalizes one of the objects in the group by marking it as
  *finalized* and calling its "tp_finalize" function, if it has one.
  This repeats until the cyclic isolate doesn't exist or all of the
  objects have been finalized.

* "tp_finalize" is permitted to resurrect the object by adding a
  reference from outside the *cyclic isolate*.  The new reference
  causes the group of objects to no longer form a cyclic isolate (the
  reference cycle may still exist, but if it does the objects are no
  longer isolated).

* When the garbage collector discovers a *cyclic isolate* and all of
  the objects in the group have already been marked as *finalized*,
  the garbage collector clears one or more of the uncleared objects in
  the group (possibly concurrently) by calling each's "tp_clear"
  function.  This repeats as long as the cyclic isolate still exists
  and not all of the objects have been cleared.

## Cyclic Isolate Destruction

Listed below are the stages of life of a hypothetical *cyclic isolate*
that continues to exist after each member object is finalized or
cleared.  It is a memory leak if a cyclic isolate progresses through
all of these stages; it should vanish once all objects are cleared, if
not sooner.  A cyclic isolate can vanish either because the reference
cycle is broken or because the objects are no longer isolated due to
finalizer resurrection (see "tp_finalize").

* **Reachable** (not yet a cyclic isolate): All objects are in their
  normal, reachable state.  A reference cycle could exist, but an
  external reference means the objects are not yet isolated.

* **Unreachable but consistent:** The final reference from outside the
  cyclic group of objects has been removed, causing the objects to
  become isolated (thus a cyclic isolate is born).  None of the
  group's objects have been finalized or cleared yet.  The cyclic
  isolate remains at this stage until some future run of the garbage
  collector (not necessarily the next run because the next run might
  not scan every object).

* **Mix of finalized and not finalized:** Objects in a cyclic isolate
  are finalized one at a time, which means that there is a period of
  time when the cyclic isolate is composed of a mix of finalized and
  non-finalized objects. Finalization order is unspecified, so it can
  appear random.  A finalized object must behave in a sane manner when
  non-finalized objects interact with it, and a non-finalized object
  must be able to tolerate the finalization of an arbitrary subset of
  its referents.

* **All finalized:** All objects in a cyclic isolate are finalized
  before any of them are cleared.

* **Mix of finalized and cleared:** The objects can be cleared
  serially or concurrently (but with the *GIL* held); either way, some
  will finish before others.  A finalized object must be able to
  tolerate the clearing of a subset of its referents.  **PEP 442**
  calls this stage "cyclic trash".

* **Leaked:** If a cyclic isolate still exists after all objects in
  the group have been finalized and cleared, then the objects remain
  indefinitely uncollectable (see "gc.garbage").  It is a bug if a
  cyclic isolate reaches this stage---it means the "tp_clear" methods
  of the participating objects have failed to break the reference
  cycle as required.

If "tp_clear" did not exist, then Python would have no way to safely
break a reference cycle.  Simply destroying an object in a cyclic
isolate would result in a dangling pointer, triggering undefined
behavior when an object referencing the destroyed object is itself
destroyed.  The clearing step makes object destruction a two-phase
process: first "tp_clear" is called to partially destroy the objects
enough to detangle them from each other, then "tp_dealloc" is called
to complete the destruction.

Unlike clearing, finalization is not a phase of destruction.  A
finalized object must still behave properly by continuing to fulfill
its design contracts.  An object's finalizer is allowed to execute
arbitrary Python code, and is even allowed to prevent the impending
destruction by adding a reference. The finalizer is only related to
destruction by call order---if it runs, it runs before destruction,
which starts with "tp_clear" (if called) and concludes with
"tp_dealloc".

The finalization step is not necessary to safely reclaim the objects
in a cyclic isolate, but its existence makes it easier to design types
that behave in a sane manner when objects are cleared.  Clearing an
object might necessarily leave it in a broken, partially destroyed
state---it might be unsafe to call any of the cleared object's methods
or access any of its attributes.  With finalization, only finalized
objects can possibly interact with cleared objects; non-finalized
objects are guaranteed to interact with only non-cleared (but
potentially finalized) objects.

To summarize the possible interactions:

* A non-finalized object might have references to or from non-
  finalized and finalized objects, but not to or from cleared objects.

* A finalized object might have references to or from non-finalized,
  finalized, and cleared objects.

* A cleared object might have references to or from finalized and
  cleared objects, but not to or from non-finalized objects.

Without any reference cycles, an object can be simply destroyed once
its last reference is deleted; the finalization and clearing steps are
not necessary to safely reclaim unused objects.  However, it can be
useful to automatically call "tp_finalize" and "tp_clear" before
destruction anyway because type design is simplified when all objects
always experience the same series of events regardless of whether they
participated in a cyclic isolate.  Python currently only calls
"tp_finalize" and "tp_clear" as needed to destroy a cyclic isolate;
this may change in a future version.

## Functions

To allocate and free memory, see Allocating objects on the heap.

void PyObject_CallFinalizer(PyObject *op)

   Finalizes the object as described in "tp_finalize". Call this
   function (or "PyObject_CallFinalizerFromDealloc()") instead of
   calling "tp_finalize" directly because this function may
   deduplicate multiple calls to "tp_finalize". Currently, calls are
   only deduplicated if the type supports garbage collection (i.e.,
   the "Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC" flag is set); this may change in the
   future.

   Added in version 3.4.

int PyObject_CallFinalizerFromDealloc(PyObject *op)

   Same as "PyObject_CallFinalizer()" but meant to be called at the
   beginning of the object's destructor ("tp_dealloc"). There must not
   be any references to the object.  If the object's finalizer
   resurrects the object, this function returns -1; no further
   destruction should happen.  Otherwise, this function returns 0 and
   destruction can continue normally.

   Added in version 3.4.
