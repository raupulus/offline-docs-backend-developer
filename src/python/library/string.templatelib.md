## Template strings

Added in version 3.14.

Template strings are a mechanism for custom string processing. They
have the full flexibility of Python's f-strings, but return a
"Template" instance that gives access to the static and interpolated
(in curly brackets) parts of a string *before* they are combined.

To write a t-string, use a "'t'" prefix instead of an "'f'", like so:

   >>> pi = 3.14
   >>> t't-strings are new in Python {pi!s}!'
   Template(
      strings=('t-strings are new in Python ', '!'),
      interpolations=(Interpolation(3.14, 'pi', 's', ''),)
   )

## Types

class string.templatelib.Template

   The "Template" class describes the contents of a template string.
   It is immutable, meaning that attributes of a template cannot be
   reassigned.

   The most common way to create a "Template" instance is to use the
   template string literal syntax. This syntax is identical to that of
   f-strings, except that it uses a "t" prefix in place of an "f":

   >>> cheese = 'Red Leicester'
   >>> template = t"We're fresh out of {cheese}, sir."
   >>> type(template)
   <class 'string.templatelib.Template'>

   Templates are stored as sequences of literal "strings" and dynamic
   "interpolations". A "values" attribute holds the values of the
   interpolations:

   >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
   >>> template = t'Ah! We do have {cheese}.'
   >>> template.strings
   ('Ah! We do have ', '.')
   >>> template.interpolations
   (Interpolation('Camembert', ...),)
   >>> template.values
   ('Camembert',)

   The "strings" tuple has one more element than "interpolations" and
   "values"; the interpolations “belong” between the strings. This may
   be easier to understand when tuples are aligned

      template.strings:  ('Ah! We do have ',              '.')
      template.values:   (                   'Camembert',    )

   -[ Attributes ]-

   strings: tuple[str, ...]

      A "tuple" of the static strings in the template.

      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template = t'Ah! We do have {cheese}.'
      >>> template.strings
      ('Ah! We do have ', '.')

      Empty strings *are* included in the tuple:

      >>> response = 'We do have '
      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template = t'Ah! {response}{cheese}.'
      >>> template.strings
      ('Ah! ', '', '.')

      The "strings" tuple is never empty, and always contains one more
      string than the "interpolations" and "values" tuples:

      >>> t''.strings
      ('',)
      >>> t''.values
      ()
      >>> t'{'cheese'}'.strings
      ('', '')
      >>> t'{'cheese'}'.values
      ('cheese',)

   interpolations: tuple[Interpolation, ...]

      A "tuple" of the interpolations in the template.

      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template = t'Ah! We do have {cheese}.'
      >>> template.interpolations
      (Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''),)

      The "interpolations" tuple may be empty and always contains one
      fewer values than the "strings" tuple:

      >>> t'Red Leicester'.interpolations
      ()

   values: tuple[object, ...]

      A tuple of all interpolated values in the template.

      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template = t'Ah! We do have {cheese}.'
      >>> template.values
      ('Camembert',)

      The "values" tuple always has the same length as the
      "interpolations" tuple. It is always equivalent to
      "tuple(i.value for i in template.interpolations)".

   -[ Methods ]-

   __new__(*args: str | Interpolation)

      While literal syntax is the most common way to create a
      "Template", it is also possible to create them directly using
      the constructor:

      >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation, Template
      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template = Template(
      ...     'Ah! We do have ', Interpolation(cheese, 'cheese'), '.'
      ... )
      >>> list(template)
      ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.']

      If multiple strings are passed consecutively, they will be
      concatenated into a single value in the "strings" attribute. For
      example, the following code creates a "Template" with a single
      final string:

      >>> from string.templatelib import Template
      >>> template = Template('Ah! We do have ', 'Camembert', '.')
      >>> template.strings
      ('Ah! We do have Camembert.',)

      If multiple interpolations are passed consecutively, they will
      be treated as separate interpolations and an empty string will
      be inserted between them. For example, the following code
      creates a template with empty placeholders in the "strings"
      attribute:

      >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation, Template
      >>> template = Template(
      ...     Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese'),
      ...     Interpolation('.', 'punctuation'),
      ... )
      >>> template.strings
      ('', '', '')

   iter(template)

      Iterate over the template, yielding each non-empty string and
      "Interpolation" in the correct order:

      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> list(t'Ah! We do have {cheese}.')
      ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.']

      Prudencia:

        Empty strings are **not** included in the iteration:

        >>> response = 'We do have '
        >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
        >>> list(t'Ah! {response}{cheese}.')
        ['Ah! ',
         Interpolation('We do have ', 'response', None, ''),
         Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''),
         '.']

   template + other
   template += other

      Concatenate this template with another, returning a new
      "Template" instance:

      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> list(t'Ah! ' + t'We do have {cheese}.')
      ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.']

      Concatenating a "Template" and a "str" is **not** supported.
      This is because it is unclear whether the string should be
      treated as a static string or an interpolation. If you want to
      concatenate a "Template" with a string, you should either wrap
      the string directly in a "Template" (to treat it as a static
      string) or use an "Interpolation" (to treat it as dynamic):

      >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation, Template
      >>> template = t'Ah! '
      >>> # Treat 'We do have ' as a static string
      >>> template += Template('We do have ')
      >>> # Treat cheese as an interpolation
      >>> cheese = 'Camembert'
      >>> template += Template(Interpolation(cheese, 'cheese'))
      >>> list(template)
      ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, '')]

class string.templatelib.Interpolation

   The "Interpolation" type represents an expression inside a template
   string. It is immutable, meaning that attributes of an
   interpolation cannot be reassigned.

   Interpolations support pattern matching, allowing you to match
   against their attributes with the match statement:

   >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation
   >>> interpolation = t'{1. + 2.:.2f}'.interpolations[0]
   >>> interpolation
   Interpolation(3.0, '1. + 2.', None, '.2f')
   >>> match interpolation:
   ...     case Interpolation(value, expression, conversion, format_spec):
   ...         print(value, expression, conversion, format_spec, sep=' | ')
   ...
   3.0 | 1. + 2. | None | .2f

   Interpolations are generic over the types of their values.

   -[ Attributes ]-

   value: object

      The evaluated value of the interpolation.

      >>> t'{1 + 2}'.interpolations[0].value
      3

   expression: str

      For interpolations created by t-string literals, "expression" is
      the expression text found inside the curly brackets ("{" & "}"),
      including any whitespace, excluding the curly brackets
      themselves, and ending before the first "!", ":", or "=" if any
      is present. For manually created interpolations, "expression" is
      the arbitrary string provided when constructing the
      interpolation instance.

      We recommend using valid Python expressions or the empty string
      for the "expression" field of manually created "Interpolation"
      instances, although this is not enforced at runtime.

      >>> t'{1 + 2}'.interpolations[0].expression
      '1 + 2'

   conversion: Literal['a', 'r', 's'] | None

      The conversion to apply to the value, or "None".

      The "conversion" is the optional conversion to apply to the
      value:

      >>> t'{1 + 2!a}'.interpolations[0].conversion
      'a'

      Nota:

        Unlike f-strings, where conversions are applied automatically,
        the expected behavior with t-strings is that code that
        *processes* the "Template" will decide how to interpret and
        whether to apply the "conversion". For convenience, the
        "convert()" function can be used to mimic f-string conversion
        semantics.

   format_spec: str

      The format specification to apply to the value.

      The "format_spec" is an optional, arbitrary string used as the
      format specification to present the value:

      >>> t'{1 + 2:.2f}'.interpolations[0].format_spec
      '.2f'

      Nota:

        Unlike f-strings, where format specifications are applied
        automatically via the "format()" protocol, the expected
        behavior with t-strings is that code that *processes* the
        interpolation will decide how to interpret and whether to
        apply the format specification. As a result, "format_spec"
        values in interpolations can be arbitrary strings, including
        those that do not conform to the "format()" protocol.

   -[ Methods ]-

   __new__(value: object, expression: str, conversion: Literal['a', 'r', 's'] | None = None, format_spec: str = '')

      Create a new "Interpolation" object from component parts.

      Parámetros:
         * **value** -- The evaluated, in-scope result of the
           interpolation.

         * **expression** -- The text of a valid Python expression, or
           an empty string.

         * **conversion** -- The conversion to be used, one of "None",
           "'a'", "'r'", or "'s'".

         * **format_spec** -- An optional, arbitrary string used as
           the format specification to present the value.

## Helper functions

string.templatelib.convert(obj, /, conversion)

   Applies formatted string literal conversion semantics to the given
   object *obj*. This is frequently useful for custom template string
   processing logic.

   Three conversion flags are currently supported:

   * "'s'" which calls "str()" on the value (like "!s"),

   * "'r'" which calls "repr()" (like "!r"), and

   * "'a'" which calls "ascii()" (like "!a").

   If the conversion flag is "None", *obj* is returned unchanged.
