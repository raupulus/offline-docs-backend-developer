# The "compression" package

Added in version 3.14.

The "compression" package contains the canonical compression modules
containing interfaces to several different compression algorithms.
Some of these modules have historically been available as separate
modules; those will continue to be available under their original
names for compatibility reasons, and will not be removed without a
deprecation cycle. The use of modules in "compression" is encouraged
where practical.

* "compression.bz2" -- Re-exports "bz2"

* "compression.gzip" -- Re-exports "gzip"

* "compression.lzma" -- Re-exports "lzma"

* "compression.zlib" -- Re-exports "zlib"

* "compression.zstd" -- Wrapper for the Zstandard compression library
